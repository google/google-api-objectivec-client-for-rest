 *  Fetches a @c GTLRBigQueryReservation_SearchAssignmentsResponse.

 *  Deprecated: Looks up assignments for a specified resource for a particular
 *  region. If the request is about a project: 1. Assignments created on the
 *  project will be returned if they exist. 2. Otherwise assignments created on
 *  the closest ancestor will be returned. 3. Assignments for different JobTypes
 *  will all be returned. The same logic applies if the request is about a
 *  folder. If the request is about an organization, then assignments created on
 *  the organization will be returned (organization doesn't have ancestors).
 *  Comparing to ListAssignments, there are some behavior differences: 1.
 *  permission on the assignee will be verified in this API. 2. Hierarchy lookup
 *  (project->folder->organization) happens in this API. 3. Parent here is
 *  `projects/ * /locations/ *`, instead of `projects/ * /locations/
 *  *reservations/ *`. **Note** "-" cannot be used for projects nor locations.
 *
 *  @param parent Required. The resource name of the admin project(containing
 *    project and location), e.g.: `projects/myproject/locations/US`.

 *  @return GTLRBigQueryReservationQuery_ProjectsLocationsSearchAssignments
