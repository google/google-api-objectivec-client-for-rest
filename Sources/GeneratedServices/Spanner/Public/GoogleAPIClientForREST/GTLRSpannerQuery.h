 *  Fetches a @c GTLRSpanner_Operation.
 *
 *  Updates an instance, and begins allocating or releasing resources as

 *  progress of updating the instance. If the named instance does not exist,
 *  returns `NOT_FOUND`. Immediately upon completion of this request: * For
 *  resource types for which a decrease in the instance's allocation has been
 *  requested, billing is based on the newly-requested level. Until completion
 *  of the returned operation: * Cancelling the operation sets its metadata's
 *  cancel_time, and begins restoring resources to their pre-request values. The
 *  operation is guaranteed to succeed at undoing all resource changes, after
 *  which point it terminates with a `CANCELLED` status. * All other attempts to
 *  modify the instance are rejected. * Reading the instance via the API
 *  continues to give the pre-request resource levels. Upon completion of the
 *  returned operation: * Billing begins for all successfully-allocated
 *  resources (some types may have lower than the requested levels). * All
 *  newly-reserved resources are available for serving the instance's tables. *
 *  The instance's new resource levels are readable via the API. The returned
 *  long-running operation will have a name of the format `/operations/` and can
 *  be used to track the instance modification. The metadata field type is
 *  UpdateInstanceMetadata. The response field type is Instance, if successful.
