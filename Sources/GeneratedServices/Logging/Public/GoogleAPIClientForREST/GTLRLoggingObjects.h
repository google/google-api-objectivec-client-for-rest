 *  MiBy/10ms (although you should almost never have /s in a metric unit; rates
 *  should always be computed at query time from the underlying cumulative or
 *  delta value). . multiplication or composition (as an infix operator). For
 *  examples, GBy.d or k{watt}.h.The grammar for a unit is as follows:
 *  Expression = Component { "." Component } { "/" Component } ; Component = ( [
 *  PREFIX ] UNIT | "%" ) [ Annotation ] | Annotation | "1" ; Annotation = "{"
 *  NAME "}" ; Notes: Annotation is just a comment if it follows a UNIT. If the
 *  annotation is used alone, then the unit is equivalent to 1. For examples,
 *  {request}/s == 1/s, By{transmitted}/s == By/s. NAME is a sequence of
 *  non-blank printable ASCII characters not containing { or }. 1 represents a
 *  unitary dimensionless unit
 *  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_quantity) of 1, such as in 1/s.
 *  It is typically used when none of the basic units are appropriate. For
 *  example, "new users per day" can be represented as 1/d or {new-users}/d (and
 *  a metric value 5 would mean "5 new users). Alternatively, "thousands of page
 *  views per day" would be represented as 1000/d or k1/d or k{page_views}/d
 *  (and a metric value of 5.3 would mean "5300 page views per day"). %
 *  represents dimensionless value of 1/100, and annotates values giving a
 *  percentage (so the metric values are typically in the range of 0..100, and a
 *  metric value 3 means "3 percent"). 10^2.% indicates a metric contains a
 *  ratio, typically in the range 0..1, that will be multiplied by 100 and
