 *  directories in `my-project` -- `gcr.i*` is not allowed since the registry is
 *  not completely specified -- `sub*domain.gcr.io/nginx` is not valid because
 *  only leading `*` or trailing `*` are allowed. --
 *  `*pkg.dev/my-project/my-repo` is not valid because leading `*` can only
 *  match subdomain -- `**-docker.pkg.dev` is not valid because one leading `*`
 *  is allowed, and that it cannot match `/`
