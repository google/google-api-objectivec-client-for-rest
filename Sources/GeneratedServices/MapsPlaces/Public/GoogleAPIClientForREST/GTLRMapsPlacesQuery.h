 *  or Address Validation request. The credentials used for each request within

 *  token was provided (each request is billed separately). We recommend the

 *  * Generate a fresh token for each session. Using a version 4 UUID is
 *  recommended. * Ensure that the credentials used for all Place Autocomplete,
 *  Place Details, and Address Validation requests within a session belong to
 *  the same Cloud Console project. * Be sure to pass a unique session token for
 *  each new session. Using the same token for more than one session will result
