/**
 *  # gRPC Transcoding gRPC Transcoding is a feature for mapping between a gRPC
 *  method and one or more HTTP REST endpoints. It allows developers to build a
 *  single API service that supports both gRPC APIs and REST APIs. Many systems,
 *  including [Google APIs](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis), [Cloud
 *  Endpoints](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints), [gRPC
 *  Gateway](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway), and
 *  [Envoy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy) proxy support this feature and
 *  use it for large scale production services. `HttpRule` defines the schema of
 *  the gRPC/REST mapping. The mapping specifies how different portions of the
 *  gRPC request message are mapped to the URL path, URL query parameters, and
 *  HTTP request body. It also controls how the gRPC response message is mapped
 *  to the HTTP response body. `HttpRule` is typically specified as an
 *  `google.api.http` annotation on the gRPC method. Each mapping specifies a
 *  URL path template and an HTTP method. The path template may refer to one or
 *  more fields in the gRPC request message, as long as each field is a
 *  non-repeated field with a primitive (non-message) type. The path template
 *  controls how fields of the request message are mapped to the URL path.
 *  Example: service Messaging { rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns
 *  (Message) { option (google.api.http) = { get: "/v1/{name=messages/ *}" }; }
 *  } message GetMessageRequest { string name = 1; // Mapped to URL path. }
 *  message Message { string text = 1; // The resource content. } This enables
 *  an HTTP REST to gRPC mapping as below: HTTP | gRPC -----|----- `GET
 *  /v1/messages/123456` | `GetMessage(name: "messages/123456")` Any fields in
 *  the request message which are not bound by the path template automatically
 *  become HTTP query parameters if there is no HTTP request body. For example:
 *  service Messaging { rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
 *  option (google.api.http) = { get:"/v1/messages/{message_id}" }; } } message
 *  GetMessageRequest { message SubMessage { string subfield = 1; } string
 *  message_id = 1; // Mapped to URL path. int64 revision = 2; // Mapped to URL
 *  query parameter `revision`. SubMessage sub = 3; // Mapped to URL query
 *  parameter `sub.subfield`. } This enables a HTTP JSON to RPC mapping as
 *  below: HTTP | gRPC -----|----- `GET
 *  /v1/messages/123456?revision=2&sub.subfield=foo` | `GetMessage(message_id:
 *  "123456" revision: 2 sub: SubMessage(subfield: "foo"))` Note that fields
 *  which are mapped to URL query parameters must have a primitive type or a
 *  repeated primitive type or a non-repeated message type. In the case of a
 *  repeated type, the parameter can be repeated in the URL as
 *  `...?param=A&param=B`. In the case of a message type, each field of the
 *  message is mapped to a separate parameter, such as
 *  `...?foo.a=A&foo.b=B&foo.c=C`. For HTTP methods that allow a request body,
 *  the `body` field specifies the mapping. Consider a REST update method on the
 *  message resource collection: service Messaging { rpc
 *  UpdateMessage(UpdateMessageRequest) returns (Message) { option
 *  (google.api.http) = { patch: "/v1/messages/{message_id}" body: "message" };
 *  } } message UpdateMessageRequest { string message_id = 1; // mapped to the
 *  URL Message message = 2; // mapped to the body } The following HTTP JSON to
 *  RPC mapping is enabled, where the representation of the JSON in the request
 *  body is determined by protos JSON encoding: HTTP | gRPC -----|----- `PATCH
 *  /v1/messages/123456 { "text": "Hi!" }` | `UpdateMessage(message_id: "123456"
 *  message { text: "Hi!" })` The special name `*` can be used in the body
 *  mapping to define that every field not bound by the path template should be
 *  mapped to the request body. This enables the following alternative
 *  definition of the update method: service Messaging { rpc
 *  UpdateMessage(Message) returns (Message) { option (google.api.http) = {
 *  patch: "/v1/messages/{message_id}" body: "*" }; } } message Message { string
 *  message_id = 1; string text = 2; } The following HTTP JSON to RPC mapping is
 *  enabled: HTTP | gRPC -----|----- `PATCH /v1/messages/123456 { "text": "Hi!"
 *  }` | `UpdateMessage(message_id: "123456" text: "Hi!")` Note that when using
 *  `*` in the body mapping, it is not possible to have HTTP parameters, as all
 *  fields not bound by the path end in the body. This makes this option more
 *  rarely used in practice when defining REST APIs. The common usage of `*` is
 *  in custom methods which don't use the URL at all for transferring data. It
 *  is possible to define multiple HTTP methods for one RPC by using the
 *  `additional_bindings` option. Example: service Messaging { rpc
 *  GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) { option (google.api.http) =
 *  { get: "/v1/messages/{message_id}" additional_bindings { get:
 *  "/v1/users/{user_id}/messages/{message_id}" } }; } } message
 *  GetMessageRequest { string message_id = 1; string user_id = 2; } This
 *  enables the following two alternative HTTP JSON to RPC mappings: HTTP | gRPC
 *  -----|----- `GET /v1/messages/123456` | `GetMessage(message_id: "123456")`
 *  `GET /v1/users/me/messages/123456` | `GetMessage(user_id: "me" message_id:
 *  "123456")` ## Rules for HTTP mapping 1. Leaf request fields (recursive
 *  expansion nested messages in the request message) are classified into three
 *  categories: - Fields referred by the path template. They are passed via the
 *  URL path. - Fields referred by the HttpRule.body. They are passed via the
 *  HTTP request body. - All other fields are passed via the URL query
 *  parameters, and the parameter name is the field path in the request message.
 *  A repeated field can be represented as multiple query parameters under the
 *  same name. 2. If HttpRule.body is "*", there is no URL query parameter, all
 *  fields are passed via URL path and HTTP request body. 3. If HttpRule.body is
 *  omitted, there is no HTTP request body, all fields are passed via URL path
 *  and URL query parameters. ### Path template syntax Template = "/" Segments [
 *  Verb ] ; Segments = Segment { "/" Segment } ; Segment = "*" | "**" | LITERAL
 *  | Variable ; Variable = "{" FieldPath [ "=" Segments ] "}" ; FieldPath =
 *  IDENT { "." IDENT } ; Verb = ":" LITERAL ; The syntax `*` matches a single
 *  URL path segment. The syntax `**` matches zero or more URL path segments,
 *  which must be the last part of the URL path except the `Verb`. The syntax
 *  `Variable` matches part of the URL path as specified by its template. A
 *  variable template must not contain other variables. If a variable matches a
 *  single path segment, its template may be omitted, e.g. `{var}` is equivalent
 *  to `{var=*}`. The syntax `LITERAL` matches literal text in the URL path. If
 *  the `LITERAL` contains any reserved character, such characters should be
 *  percent-encoded before the matching. If a variable contains exactly one path
 *  segment, such as `"{var}"` or `"{var=*}"`, when such a variable is expanded
 *  into a URL path on the client side, all characters except `[-_.~0-9a-zA-Z]`
 *  are percent-encoded. The server side does the reverse decoding. Such
 *  variables show up in the [Discovery
 *  Document](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/reference/apis) as
 *  `{var}`. If a variable contains multiple path segments, such as `"{var=foo/
 *  *}"` or `"{var=**}"`, when such a variable is expanded into a URL path on
 *  the client side, all characters except `[-_.~/0-9a-zA-Z]` are
 *  percent-encoded. The server side does the reverse decoding, except "%2F" and
 *  "%2f" are left unchanged. Such variables show up in the [Discovery
 *  Document](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/reference/apis) as
 *  `{+var}`. ## Using gRPC API Service Configuration gRPC API Service
 *  Configuration (service config) is a configuration language for configuring a
 *  gRPC service to become a user-facing product. The service config is simply
 *  the YAML representation of the `google.api.Service` proto message. As an
 *  alternative to annotating your proto file, you can configure gRPC
 *  transcoding in your service config YAML files. You do this by specifying a
 *  `HttpRule` that maps the gRPC method to a REST endpoint, achieving the same
 *  effect as the proto annotation. This can be particularly useful if you have
 *  a proto that is reused in multiple services. Note that any transcoding
 *  specified in the service config will override any matching transcoding
 *  configuration in the proto. Example: http: rules: # Selects a gRPC method
 *  and applies HttpRule to it. - selector: example.v1.Messaging.GetMessage get:
 *  /v1/messages/{message_id}/{sub.subfield} ## Special notes When gRPC
 *  Transcoding is used to map a gRPC to JSON REST endpoints, the proto to JSON
 *  conversion must follow the [proto3
 *  specification](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json).
 *  While the single segment variable follows the semantics of [RFC
 *  6570](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570) Section 3.2.2 Simple String
 *  Expansion, the multi segment variable **does not** follow RFC 6570 Section
 *  3.2.3 Reserved Expansion. The reason is that the Reserved Expansion does not
 *  expand special characters like `?` and `#`, which would lead to invalid
 *  URLs. As the result, gRPC Transcoding uses a custom encoding for multi
 *  segment variables. The path variables **must not** refer to any repeated or
 *  mapped field, because client libraries are not capable of handling such
 *  variable expansion. The path variables **must not** capture the leading "/"
 *  character. The reason is that the most common use case "{var}" does not
 *  capture the leading "/" character. For consistency, all path variables must
 *  share the same behavior. Repeated message fields must not be mapped to URL
 *  query parameters, because no client library can support such complicated
 *  mapping. If an API needs to use a JSON array for request or response body,
 *  it can map the request or response body to a repeated field. However, some
 *  gRPC Transcoding implementations may not support this feature.

 *  _might_ be displayed as `20By`, and a value of `3523kBy` _might_ be
 *  displayed as `3.5MBy`). However, if the `unit` is `kBy`, then the value of
 *  the metric is always in thousands of bytes, no matter how it might be
 *  displayed. If you want a custom metric to record the exact number of
 *  CPU-seconds used by a job, you can create an `INT64 CUMULATIVE` metric whose
 *  `unit` is `s{CPU}` (or equivalently `1s{CPU}` or just `s`). If the job uses
 *  12,005 CPU-seconds, then the value is written as `12005`. Alternatively, if

 *  `u` micro (10^-6) * `n` nano (10^-9) * `p` pico (10^-12) * `f` femto

 *  `Pi` pebi (2^50) **Grammar** The grammar also includes these connectors: *
 *  `/` division or ratio (as an infix operator). For examples, `kBy/{email}` or
 *  `MiBy/10ms` (although you should almost never have `/s` in a metric `unit`;
 *  rates should always be computed at query time from the underlying cumulative
 *  or delta value). * `.` multiplication or composition (as an infix operator).
 *  For examples, `GBy.d` or `k{watt}.h`. The grammar for a unit is as follows:
 *  Expression = Component { "." Component } { "/" Component } ; Component = ( [
 *  PREFIX ] UNIT | "%" ) [ Annotation ] | Annotation | "1" ; Annotation = "{"
 *  NAME "}" ; Notes: * `Annotation` is just a comment if it follows a `UNIT`.
 *  If the annotation is used alone, then the unit is equivalent to `1`. For
 *  examples, `{request}/s == 1/s`, `By{transmitted}/s == By/s`. * `NAME` is a
 *  sequence of non-blank printable ASCII characters not containing `{` or `}`.
 *  * `1` represents a unitary [dimensionless
 *  unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_quantity) of 1, such as in
 *  `1/s`. It is typically used when none of the basic units are appropriate.
 *  For example, "new users per day" can be represented as `1/d` or
 *  `{new-users}/d` (and a metric value `5` would mean "5 new users).
 *  Alternatively, "thousands of page views per day" would be represented as
 *  `1000/d` or `k1/d` or `k{page_views}/d` (and a metric value of `5.3` would
 *  mean "5300 page views per day"). * `%` represents dimensionless value of
 *  1/100, and annotates values giving a percentage (so the metric values are
 *  typically in the range of 0..100, and a metric value `3` means "3 percent").
 *  * `10^2.%` indicates a metric contains a ratio, typically in the range 0..1,
 *  that will be multiplied by 100 and displayed as a percentage (so a metric
 *  value `0.03` means "3 percent").
