//   Retention and eDiscovery for Google Workspace. To work with Vault
//   resources, the account must have the [required Vault
//   privileges](https://support.google.com/vault/answer/2799699) and access to
//   the matter. To access a matter, the account must have created the matter,
//   have the matter shared with them, or have the **View All Matters**
//   privilege. For example, to download an export, an account needs the
//   **Manage Exports** privilege and the matter shared with them.
