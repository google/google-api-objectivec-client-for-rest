// API:
//   Address Validation API (addressvalidation/v1)
// Description:
//   The Address Validation API allows developers to verify the accuracy of
//   addresses. Given an address, it returns information about the correctness
//   of the components of the parsed address, a geocode, and a verdict on the
//   deliverability of the parsed address.
// Documentation:
//   https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/addressvalidation
