// Description:
//   Enables client applications to check web resources (most commonly URLs)
//   against Google-generated lists of unsafe web resources. The Safe Browsing
//   APIs are for non-commercial use only. If you need to use APIs to detect
//   malicious URLs for commercial purposes – meaning “for sale or
//   revenue-generating purposes” – please refer to the Web Risk API.
// Documentation:
