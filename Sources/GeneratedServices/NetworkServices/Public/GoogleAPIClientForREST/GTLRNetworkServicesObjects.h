/**
 *  An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
 *  controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
 *  `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
 *  single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
 *  groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
 *  permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
 *  custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also
 *  specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a
 *  resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add
 *  constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To
 *  learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
 *  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).
 *  **JSON example:** { "bindings": [ { "role":
 *  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
 *  "user:mike\@example.com", "group:admins\@example.com", "domain:google.com",
 *  "serviceAccount:my-project-id\@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role":
 *  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [
 *  "user:eve\@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access",
 *  "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression":
 *  "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag":
 *  "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: -
 *  user:mike\@example.com - group:admins\@example.com - domain:google.com -
 *  serviceAccount:my-project-id\@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role:
 *  roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve\@example.com
