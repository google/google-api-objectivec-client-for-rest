/**
 *  Required. A comma-separated list of paths, relative to `Environment`, of
 *  fields to update. For example, to set the version of scikit-learn to install
 *  in the environment to 0.19.0 and to remove an existing installation of
 *  numpy, the `updateMask` parameter would include the following two `paths`
 *  values: "config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages.scikit-learn" and
 *  "config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages.numpy". The included patch environment
 *  would specify the scikit-learn version as follows: { "config":{
 *  "softwareConfig":{ "pypiPackages":{ "scikit-learn":"==0.19.0" } } } } Note
 *  that in the above example, any existing PyPI packages other than
 *  scikit-learn and numpy will be unaffected. Only one update type may be
 *  included in a single request's `updateMask`. For example, one cannot update
 *  both the PyPI packages and labels in the same request. However, it is
 *  possible to update multiple members of a map field simultaneously in the
 *  same request. For example, to set the labels "label1" and "label2" while
 *  clearing "label3" (assuming it already exists), one can provide the paths
 *  "labels.label1", "labels.label2", and "labels.label3" and populate the patch
 *  environment as follows: { "labels":{ "label1":"new-label1-value"
 *  "label2":"new-label2-value" } } Note that in the above example, any existing
 *  labels that are not included in the `updateMask` will be unaffected. It is
 *  also possible to replace an entire map field by providing the map field's
 *  path in the `updateMask`. The new value of the field will be that which is
 *  provided in the patch environment. For example, to delete all pre-existing
 *  user-specified PyPI packages and install botocore at version 1.7.14, the
 *  `updateMask` would contain the path "config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages",
 *  and the patch environment would be the following: { "config":{
 *  "softwareConfig":{ "pypiPackages":{ "botocore":"==1.7.14" } } } } **Note:**
 *  Only the following fields can be updated: *
 *  `config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages` * Replace all custom custom PyPI
 *  packages. If a replacement package map is not included in `environment`, all
 *  custom PyPI packages are cleared. It is an error to provide both this mask
 *  and a mask specifying an individual package. *
 *  `config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages.`packagename * Update the custom PyPI
 *  package *packagename*, preserving other packages. To delete the package,
 *  include it in `updateMask`, and omit the mapping for it in
 *  `environment.config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages`. It is an error to provide
 *  both a mask of this form and the `config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages` mask.
 *  * `labels` * Replace all environment labels. If a replacement labels map is
 *  not included in `environment`, all labels are cleared. It is an error to
 *  provide both this mask and a mask specifying one or more individual labels.
 *  * `labels.`labelName * Set the label named *labelName*, while preserving
 *  other labels. To delete the label, include it in `updateMask` and omit its
 *  mapping in `environment.labels`. It is an error to provide both a mask of
 *  this form and the `labels` mask. * `config.nodeCount` * Horizontally scale
 *  the number of nodes in the environment. An integer greater than or equal to
 *  3 must be provided in the `config.nodeCount` field. Supported for Cloud
 *  Composer environments in versions composer-1.*.*-airflow-*.*.*. *
 *  `config.webServerNetworkAccessControl` * Replace the environment's current
 *  `WebServerNetworkAccessControl`. *
 *  `config.softwareConfig.airflowConfigOverrides` * Replace all Apache Airflow
 *  config overrides. If a replacement config overrides map is not included in
 *  `environment`, all config overrides are cleared. It is an error to provide
 *  both this mask and a mask specifying one or more individual config
 *  overrides. * `config.softwareConfig.airflowConfigOverrides.`section-name *
 *  Override the Apache Airflow config property *name* in the section named
 *  *section*, preserving other properties. To delete the property override,
 *  include it in `updateMask` and omit its mapping in
 *  `environment.config.softwareConfig.airflowConfigOverrides`. It is an error
 *  to provide both a mask of this form and the
 *  `config.softwareConfig.airflowConfigOverrides` mask. *
 *  `config.softwareConfig.envVariables` * Replace all environment variables. If
 *  a replacement environment variable map is not included in `environment`, all
 *  custom environment variables are cleared. *
 *  `config.softwareConfig.schedulerCount` * Horizontally scale the number of
 *  schedulers in Airflow. A positive integer not greater than the number of
 *  nodes must be provided in the `config.softwareConfig.schedulerCount` field.
 *  Supported for Cloud Composer environments in versions
 *  composer-1.*.*-airflow-2.*.*. * `config.databaseConfig.machineType` * Cloud
 *  SQL machine type used by Airflow database. It has to be one of:
 *  db-n1-standard-2, db-n1-standard-4, db-n1-standard-8 or db-n1-standard-16.
 *  Supported for Cloud Composer environments in versions
