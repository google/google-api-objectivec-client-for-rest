// API:
//   Cloud Data Fusion API (datafusion/v1)
// Description:
//   Cloud Data Fusion is a fully-managed, cloud native, enterprise data
//   integration service for quickly building and managing data pipelines. It
//   provides a graphical interface to increase time efficiency and reduce
//   complexity, and allows business users, developers, and data scientists to
//   easily and reliably build scalable data integration solutions to cleanse,
//   prepare, blend, transfer and transform data without having to wrestle with
//   infrastructure.
// Documentation:

 *  An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access

 *  specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a
