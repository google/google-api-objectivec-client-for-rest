// API:
//   Access Context Manager API (accesscontextmanager/v1)
// Description:
//   An API for setting attribute based access control to requests to Google
//   Cloud services. *Warning:* Do not mix *v1alpha* and *v1* API usage in the
//   same access policy. The v1alpha API supports new Access Context Manager
//   features, which may have different attributes or behaviors that are not
//   supported by v1. The practice of mixed API usage within a policy may result
//   in the inability to update that policy, including any access levels or
//   service perimeters belonging to it. It is not recommended to use both v1
//   and v1alpha for modifying policies with critical service perimeters.
//   Modifications using v1alpha should be limited to policies with
//   non-production/non-critical service perimeters.
// Documentation:
//   https://cloud.google.com/access-context-manager/docs/reference/rest/
