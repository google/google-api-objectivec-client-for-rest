 *    @arg @c kGTLRGenomics_FailedEvent_Code_AlreadyExists The entity that a
 *        client attempted to create (e.g., file or directory) already exists.
 *        HTTP Mapping: 409 Conflict (Value: "ALREADY_EXISTS")
 *    @arg @c kGTLRGenomics_FailedEvent_Code_Cancelled The operation was
 *        cancelled, typically by the caller. HTTP Mapping: 499 Client Closed
 *        Request (Value: "CANCELLED")
 *    @arg @c kGTLRGenomics_FailedEvent_Code_DataLoss Unrecoverable data loss or
 *        corruption. HTTP Mapping: 500 Internal Server Error (Value:
 *        "DATA_LOSS")
 *    @arg @c kGTLRGenomics_FailedEvent_Code_DeadlineExceeded The deadline
 *        expired before the operation could complete. For operations that
 *        change the state of the system, this error may be returned even if the
 *        operation has completed successfully. For example, a successful
 *        response from a server could have been delayed long enough for the
 *        deadline to expire. HTTP Mapping: 504 Gateway Timeout (Value:
 *        "DEADLINE_EXCEEDED")
 *    @arg @c kGTLRGenomics_FailedEvent_Code_FailedPrecondition The operation
 *        was rejected because the system is not in a state required for the
 *        operation's execution. For example, the directory to be deleted is
 *        non-empty, an rmdir operation is applied to a non-directory, etc.
 *        Service implementors can use the following guidelines to decide
 *        between `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, `ABORTED`, and `UNAVAILABLE`: (a) Use
 *        `UNAVAILABLE` if the client can retry just the failing call. (b) Use
 *        `ABORTED` if the client should retry at a higher level. For example,
 *        when a client-specified test-and-set fails, indicating the client
 *        should restart a read-modify-write sequence. (c) Use
 *        `FAILED_PRECONDITION` if the client should not retry until the system
 *        state has been explicitly fixed. For example, if an "rmdir" fails
 *        because the directory is non-empty, `FAILED_PRECONDITION` should be
 *        returned since the client should not retry unless the files are
 *        deleted from the directory. HTTP Mapping: 400 Bad Request (Value:
 *        "FAILED_PRECONDITION")
 *    @arg @c kGTLRGenomics_FailedEvent_Code_Internal Internal errors. This
 *        means that some invariants expected by the underlying system have been
 *        broken. This error code is reserved for serious errors. HTTP Mapping:
 *        500 Internal Server Error (Value: "INTERNAL")
 *    @arg @c kGTLRGenomics_FailedEvent_Code_InvalidArgument The client
 *        specified an invalid argument. Note that this differs from
 *        `FAILED_PRECONDITION`. `INVALID_ARGUMENT` indicates arguments that are
 *        problematic regardless of the state of the system (e.g., a malformed
 *        file name). HTTP Mapping: 400 Bad Request (Value: "INVALID_ARGUMENT")
 *    @arg @c kGTLRGenomics_FailedEvent_Code_NotFound Some requested entity
 *        (e.g., file or directory) was not found. Note to server developers: if
 *        a request is denied for an entire class of users, such as gradual
 *        feature rollout or undocumented allowlist, `NOT_FOUND` may be used. If
 *        a request is denied for some users within a class of users, such as
 *        user-based access control, `PERMISSION_DENIED` must be used. HTTP
 *        Mapping: 404 Not Found (Value: "NOT_FOUND")
 *    @arg @c kGTLRGenomics_FailedEvent_Code_Ok Not an error; returned on
 *        success. HTTP Mapping: 200 OK (Value: "OK")
 *    @arg @c kGTLRGenomics_FailedEvent_Code_OutOfRange The operation was
 *        attempted past the valid range. E.g., seeking or reading past
 *        end-of-file. Unlike `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, this error indicates a problem
 *        that may be fixed if the system state changes. For example, a 32-bit
 *        file system will generate `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if asked to read at an
 *        offset that is not in the range [0,2^32-1], but it will generate
 *        `OUT_OF_RANGE` if asked to read from an offset past the current file
 *        size. There is a fair bit of overlap between `FAILED_PRECONDITION` and
 *        `OUT_OF_RANGE`. We recommend using `OUT_OF_RANGE` (the more specific
 *        error) when it applies so that callers who are iterating through a
 *        space can easily look for an `OUT_OF_RANGE` error to detect when they
 *        are done. HTTP Mapping: 400 Bad Request (Value: "OUT_OF_RANGE")
 *    @arg @c kGTLRGenomics_FailedEvent_Code_PermissionDenied The caller does
 *        not have permission to execute the specified operation.
 *        `PERMISSION_DENIED` must not be used for rejections caused by
 *        exhausting some resource (use `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` instead for those
 *        errors). `PERMISSION_DENIED` must not be used if the caller can not be
 *        identified (use `UNAUTHENTICATED` instead for those errors). This
 *        error code does not imply the request is valid or the requested entity
 *        exists or satisfies other pre-conditions. HTTP Mapping: 403 Forbidden
 *        (Value: "PERMISSION_DENIED")
 *    @arg @c kGTLRGenomics_FailedEvent_Code_ResourceExhausted Some resource has
 *        been exhausted, perhaps a per-user quota, or perhaps the entire file
 *        system is out of space. HTTP Mapping: 429 Too Many Requests (Value:
 *        "RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED")
 *    @arg @c kGTLRGenomics_FailedEvent_Code_Unauthenticated The request does
 *        not have valid authentication credentials for the operation. HTTP
 *        Mapping: 401 Unauthorized (Value: "UNAUTHENTICATED")
 *    @arg @c kGTLRGenomics_FailedEvent_Code_Unavailable The service is
 *        currently unavailable. This is most likely a transient condition,
 *        which can be corrected by retrying with a backoff. Note that it is not
 *        always safe to retry non-idempotent operations. See the guidelines
 *        above for deciding between `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, `ABORTED`, and
 *        `UNAVAILABLE`. HTTP Mapping: 503 Service Unavailable (Value:
 *        "UNAVAILABLE")

 *    @arg @c kGTLRGenomics_FailedEvent_Code_Unknown Unknown error. For example,
 *        this error may be returned when a `Status` value received from another
 *        address space belongs to an error space that is not known in this
 *        address space. Also errors raised by APIs that do not return enough
