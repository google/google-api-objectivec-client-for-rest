/**
 *  Stateless method to retrieve GHG emissions estimates for a set of flight
 *  segments for Scope 3 reporting. The response will contain all entries that
 *  match the input Scope3FlightSegment flight segments, in the same order
 *  provided. The estimates will be computed using the following cascading logic
 *  (using the first one that is available): 1. TIM-based emissions given
 *  origin, destination, carrier, flightNumber, departureDate, and cabinClass.
 *  2. Typical flight emissions given origin, destination, year in
 *  departureDate, and cabinClass. 3. Distance-based emissions calculated using
 *  distanceKm, year in departureDate, and cabinClass. If there is a future
 *  flight requested in this calendar year, we do not support Tier 1 emissions
 *  and will fallback to Tier 2 or 3 emissions. If the requested future flight
 *  is in not in this calendar year, we will return an empty response. We
 *  recommend that for future flights, computeFlightEmissions API is used
 *  instead. If there are no estimates available for a certain flight with any
 *  of the three methods, the response will return a Scope3FlightEmissions
 *  object with empty emission fields. The request will still be considered
 *  successful. Generally, missing emissions estimates occur when the flight is
 *  unknown to the server (e.g. no specific flight exists, or typical flight
 *  emissions are not available for the requested pair). The request will fail
 *  with an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error if: * The request contains more than 1,000
 *  flight legs. * The input flight leg is missing one or more identifiers. For
 *  example, missing origin/destination without a valid distance for
 *  TIM_EMISSIONS or TYPICAL_FLIGHT_EMISSIONS type matching, or missing distance
 *  for a DISTANCE_BASED_EMISSIONS type matching (if you want to fallback to
 *  distance-based emissions or want a distance-based emissions estimate, you
 *  need to specify a distance). * The flight date is before 2019 (Scope 3 data
 *  is only available for 2019 and after). * The flight distance is 0 or lower.
 *  * Missing cabin class. Because the request is processed with fallback logic,
 *  it is possible that misconfigured requests return valid emissions estimates
 *  using fallback methods. For example, if a request has the wrong flight
 *  number but specifies the origin and destination, the request will still
 *  succeed, but the returned emissions will be based solely on the typical
 *  flight emissions. Similarly, if a request is missing the origin for a
 *  typical flight emissions request, but specifies a valid distance, the
 *  request could succeed based solely on the distance-based emissions.
 *  Consequently, one should check the source of the returned emissions (source)
 *  to confirm the results are as expected.
