// API:
//   My Business Business Calls API (mybusinessbusinesscalls/v1)
// Description:
//   The My Business Business Calls API manages business calls information of a
//   location on Google and collect insights like the number of missed calls to
//   their location. Additional information about Business calls can be found at
//   https://support.google.com/business/answer/9688285?p=call_history. If the
//   Google Business Profile links to a Google Ads account and call history is
//   turned on, calls that last longer than a specific time, and that can be
//   attributed to an ad interaction, will show in the linked Google Ads account
//   under the "Calls from Ads" conversion. If smart bidding and call
//   conversions are used in the optimization strategy, there could be a change
//   in ad spend. Learn more about smart bidding. To view and perform actions on
//   a location's calls, you need to be a `OWNER`, `CO_OWNER` or `MANAGER` of
//   the location. Note - If you have a quota of 0 after enabling the API,
//   please request for GBP API access.
// Documentation:
//   https://developers.google.com/my-business/
