/**
 *  Output only. The state of the entitlement.
 *
 *  Likely values:
 *    @arg @c kGTLRCloudCommercePartnerProcurementService_Entitlement_State_EntitlementActivationRequested
 *        Indicates that the entitlement has been created, but it hasn't yet
 *        become active. The entitlement remains in this state until it becomes
 *        active. If the entitlement requires provider approval, a notification
 *        is sent to the provider for the activation approval. If the provider
 *        doesn't approve, the entitlement is removed. If approved, the
 *        entitlement transitions to the EntitlementState.ENTITLEMENT_ACTIVE
 *        state after either a short processing delay or, if applicable, at the
 *        scheduled start time of the purchased offer. Plan changes aren't
 *        allowed in this state. Instead, customers are expected to cancel the
 *        corresponding order and place a new order. (Value:
 *        "ENTITLEMENT_ACTIVATION_REQUESTED")
 *    @arg @c kGTLRCloudCommercePartnerProcurementService_Entitlement_State_EntitlementActive
 *        Indicates that the entitlement is active. The procured item is now
 *        usable and any associated billing events will start occurring.
 *        Entitlements in this state WILL renew. The analogous state for an
 *        unexpired but non-renewing entitlement is
 *        ENTITLEMENT_PENDING_CANCELLATION. In this state, the customer can
 *        decide to cancel the entitlement, which would change the state to
 *        EntitlementState.ENTITLEMENT_PENDING_CANCELLATION, and then
 *        EntitlementState.ENTITLEMENT_CANCELLED. The user can also request a
 *        change of plan, which will transition the state to
 *        EntitlementState.ENTITLEMENT_PENDING_PLAN_CHANGE, and then back to
 *        EntitlementState.ENTITLEMENT_ACTIVE. (Value: "ENTITLEMENT_ACTIVE")
 *    @arg @c kGTLRCloudCommercePartnerProcurementService_Entitlement_State_EntitlementCancelled
 *        Indicates that the entitlement was cancelled. The entitlement can now
 *        be deleted. (Value: "ENTITLEMENT_CANCELLED")
 *    @arg @c kGTLRCloudCommercePartnerProcurementService_Entitlement_State_EntitlementPendingCancellation
 *        Indicates that the entitlement will expire at the end of its term.
 *        This could mean the customer has elected not to renew this entitlement
 *        or the customer elected to cancel an entitlement that only expires at
 *        term end. The entitlement typically stays in this state if the
 *        entitlement/plan allows use of the underlying resource until the end
 *        of the current billing cycle. Once the billing cycle completes, the
 *        resource will transition to EntitlementState.ENTITLEMENT_CANCELLED
 *        state. The resource cannot be modified during this state. (Value:
 *        "ENTITLEMENT_PENDING_CANCELLATION")
 *    @arg @c kGTLRCloudCommercePartnerProcurementService_Entitlement_State_EntitlementPendingPlanChange
 *        Indicates that the entitlement is currently active, but there is a
 *        pending plan change that is requested by the customer. The entitlement
 *        typically stays in this state, if the entitlement/plan requires the
 *        completion of the current billing cycle before the plan can be
 *        changed. Once the billing cycle completes, the resource will
 *        transition to EntitlementState.ENTITLEMENT_ACTIVE, with its plan
 *        changed. (Value: "ENTITLEMENT_PENDING_PLAN_CHANGE")
 *    @arg @c kGTLRCloudCommercePartnerProcurementService_Entitlement_State_EntitlementPendingPlanChangeApproval
 *        Indicates that the entitlement is currently active, but there is a
 *        plan change request pending provider approval. If the provider
 *        approves the plan change, then the entitlement will transition either
 *        to EntitlementState.ENTITLEMENT_ACTIVE or
 *        EntitlementState.ENTITLEMENT_PENDING_PLAN_CHANGE depending on whether
 *        current plan requires that the billing cycle completes. If the
 *        provider rejects the plan change, then the pending plan change request
 *        is removed and the entitlement stays in
 *        EntitlementState.ENTITLEMENT_ACTIVE state with the old plan. (Value:
 *        "ENTITLEMENT_PENDING_PLAN_CHANGE_APPROVAL")
 *    @arg @c kGTLRCloudCommercePartnerProcurementService_Entitlement_State_EntitlementStateUnspecified
 *        Default state of the entitlement. It's only set to this value when the
 *        entitlement is first created and has not been initialized. (Value:
 *        "ENTITLEMENT_STATE_UNSPECIFIED")
 *    @arg @c kGTLRCloudCommercePartnerProcurementService_Entitlement_State_EntitlementSuspended
 *        Indicates that the entitlement is suspended either by Google or
 *        provider request. This can be triggered for various external reasons
 *        (e.g. expiration of credit card on the billing account, violation of
 *        terms-of-service of the provider etc.). As such, any remediating
 *        action needs to be taken externally, before the entitlement can be
 *        activated. This is not yet supported. (Value: "ENTITLEMENT_SUSPENDED")
