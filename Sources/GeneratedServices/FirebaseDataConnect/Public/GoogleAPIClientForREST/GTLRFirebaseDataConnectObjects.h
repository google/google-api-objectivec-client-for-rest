// Description:
//   Firebase Data Connect is a relational database service for mobile and web
//   apps that lets you build and scale using a fully-managed PostgreSQL
//   database powered by Cloud SQL. The REST API lets developers manage the
//   connections to their database, change the schema of their database, and
//   query the database.
// Documentation:
//   https://firebase.google.com/docs/data-connect

 *        returned even if the operation has completed successfully. For
 *        example, a successful response from a server could have been delayed
 *        long enough for the deadline to expire. HTTP Mapping: 504 Gateway
 *        Timeout (Value: "DEADLINE_EXCEEDED")
 *    @arg @c kGTLRFirebaseDataConnect_GraphqlErrorExtensions_Code_FailedPrecondition
 *        The operation was rejected because the system is not in a state
 *        required for the operation's execution. For example, the directory to
 *        be deleted is non-empty, an rmdir operation is applied to a
 *        non-directory, etc. Service implementors can use the following
 *        guidelines to decide between `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, `ABORTED`, and
 *        `UNAVAILABLE`: (a) Use `UNAVAILABLE` if the client can retry just the
 *        failing call. (b) Use `ABORTED` if the client should retry at a higher
 *        level. For example, when a client-specified test-and-set fails,
 *        indicating the client should restart a read-modify-write sequence. (c)
 *        Use `FAILED_PRECONDITION` if the client should not retry until the
 *        system state has been explicitly fixed. For example, if an "rmdir"
 *        fails because the directory is non-empty, `FAILED_PRECONDITION` should
 *        be returned since the client should not retry unless the files are
 *        deleted from the directory. HTTP Mapping: 400 Bad Request (Value:
 *        "FAILED_PRECONDITION")
 *    @arg @c kGTLRFirebaseDataConnect_GraphqlErrorExtensions_Code_Internal
 *        Internal errors. This means that some invariants expected by the
 *        underlying system have been broken. This error code is reserved for
 *        serious errors. HTTP Mapping: 500 Internal Server Error (Value:
 *        "INTERNAL")
 *    @arg @c kGTLRFirebaseDataConnect_GraphqlErrorExtensions_Code_InvalidArgument
 *        The client specified an invalid argument. Note that this differs from
 *        `FAILED_PRECONDITION`. `INVALID_ARGUMENT` indicates arguments that are
 *        problematic regardless of the state of the system (e.g., a malformed
 *        file name). HTTP Mapping: 400 Bad Request (Value: "INVALID_ARGUMENT")
 *    @arg @c kGTLRFirebaseDataConnect_GraphqlErrorExtensions_Code_NotFound Some
 *        requested entity (e.g., file or directory) was not found. Note to
 *        server developers: if a request is denied for an entire class of
 *        users, such as gradual feature rollout or undocumented allowlist,
 *        `NOT_FOUND` may be used. If a request is denied for some users within
 *        a class of users, such as user-based access control,
 *        `PERMISSION_DENIED` must be used. HTTP Mapping: 404 Not Found (Value:
 *        "NOT_FOUND")
 *    @arg @c kGTLRFirebaseDataConnect_GraphqlErrorExtensions_Code_Ok Not an
 *        error; returned on success. HTTP Mapping: 200 OK (Value: "OK")
 *    @arg @c kGTLRFirebaseDataConnect_GraphqlErrorExtensions_Code_OutOfRange
 *        The operation was attempted past the valid range. E.g., seeking or
 *        reading past end-of-file. Unlike `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, this error
 *        indicates a problem that may be fixed if the system state changes. For
 *        example, a 32-bit file system will generate `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if
 *        asked to read at an offset that is not in the range [0,2^32-1], but it
 *        will generate `OUT_OF_RANGE` if asked to read from an offset past the
 *        current file size. There is a fair bit of overlap between
 *        `FAILED_PRECONDITION` and `OUT_OF_RANGE`. We recommend using
 *        `OUT_OF_RANGE` (the more specific error) when it applies so that
 *        callers who are iterating through a space can easily look for an
 *        `OUT_OF_RANGE` error to detect when they are done. HTTP Mapping: 400
 *        Bad Request (Value: "OUT_OF_RANGE")
 *    @arg @c kGTLRFirebaseDataConnect_GraphqlErrorExtensions_Code_PermissionDenied
 *        The caller does not have permission to execute the specified
 *        operation. `PERMISSION_DENIED` must not be used for rejections caused
 *        by exhausting some resource (use `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` instead for
 *        those errors). `PERMISSION_DENIED` must not be used if the caller can
 *        not be identified (use `UNAUTHENTICATED` instead for those errors).
 *        This error code does not imply the request is valid or the requested
 *        entity exists or satisfies other pre-conditions. HTTP Mapping: 403
 *        Forbidden (Value: "PERMISSION_DENIED")
 *    @arg @c kGTLRFirebaseDataConnect_GraphqlErrorExtensions_Code_ResourceExhausted
 *        Some resource has been exhausted, perhaps a per-user quota, or perhaps
 *        the entire file system is out of space. HTTP Mapping: 429 Too Many
 *        Requests (Value: "RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED")
 *    @arg @c kGTLRFirebaseDataConnect_GraphqlErrorExtensions_Code_Unauthenticated
 *        The request does not have valid authentication credentials for the
 *        operation. HTTP Mapping: 401 Unauthorized (Value: "UNAUTHENTICATED")
 *    @arg @c kGTLRFirebaseDataConnect_GraphqlErrorExtensions_Code_Unavailable
 *        The service is currently unavailable. This is most likely a transient
 *        condition, which can be corrected by retrying with a backoff. Note
 *        that it is not always safe to retry non-idempotent operations. See the
 *        guidelines above for deciding between `FAILED_PRECONDITION`,
 *        `ABORTED`, and `UNAVAILABLE`. HTTP Mapping: 503 Service Unavailable
 *        (Value: "UNAVAILABLE")
 *    @arg @c kGTLRFirebaseDataConnect_GraphqlErrorExtensions_Code_Unimplemented
 *        The operation is not implemented or is not supported/enabled in this
 *        service. HTTP Mapping: 501 Not Implemented (Value: "UNIMPLEMENTED")
 *    @arg @c kGTLRFirebaseDataConnect_GraphqlErrorExtensions_Code_Unknown
 *        Unknown error. For example, this error may be returned when a `Status`
 *        value received from another address space belongs to an error space
 *        that is not known in this address space. Also errors raised by APIs
 *        that do not return enough error information may be converted to this
 *        error. HTTP Mapping: 500 Internal Server Error (Value: "UNKNOWN")
