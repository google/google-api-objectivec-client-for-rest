//   Firebase Data Connect is a relational database service for mobile and web
//   apps that lets you build and scale using a fully-managed PostgreSQL
//   database powered by Cloud SQL. The REST API lets developers manage the
//   connections to their database, change the schema of their database, and
//   query the database.
