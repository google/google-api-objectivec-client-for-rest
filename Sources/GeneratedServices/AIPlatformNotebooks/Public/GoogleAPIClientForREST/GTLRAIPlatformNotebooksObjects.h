/**
 *  An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access

 *  groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
 *  permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
 *  custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also
 *  specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a
 *  resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add
 *  constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To
 *  learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
