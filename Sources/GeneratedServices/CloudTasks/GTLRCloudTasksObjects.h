/**
 *  App Engine HTTP request. The message defines the HTTP request that is sent
 *  to an App Engine app when the task is dispatched. Using AppEngineHttpRequest
 *  requires
 *  [`appengine.applications.get`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/admin-api/access-control)
 *  Google IAM permission for the project and the following scope:
 *  `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform` The task will be delivered
 *  to the App Engine app which belongs to the same project as the queue. For
 *  more information, see [How Requests are
 *  Routed](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/how-requests-are-routed)
 *  and how routing is affected by [dispatch
 *  files](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/dispatchref).
 *  Traffic is encrypted during transport and never leaves Google datacenters.
 *  Because this traffic is carried over a communication mechanism internal to
 *  Google, you cannot explicitly set the protocol (for example, HTTP or HTTPS).
 *  The request to the handler, however, will appear to have used the HTTP
 *  protocol. The AppEngineRouting used to construct the URL that the task is
 *  delivered to can be set at the queue-level or task-level: * If
 *  app_engine_routing_override is set on the queue, this value is used for all
 *  tasks in the queue, no matter what the setting is for the task-level
 *  app_engine_routing. The `url` that the task will be sent to is: * `url =`
 *  host `+` relative_uri Tasks can be dispatched to secure app handlers,
 *  unsecure app handlers, and URIs restricted with [`login:
 *  admin`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/appref).
 *  Because tasks are not run as any user, they cannot be dispatched to URIs
 *  restricted with [`login:
 *  required`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/appref)
 *  Task dispatches also do not follow redirects. The task attempt has succeeded
 *  if the app's request handler returns an HTTP response code in the range
 *  [`200` - `299`]. The task attempt has failed if the app's handler returns a
 *  non-2xx response code or Cloud Tasks does not receive response before the
 *  deadline. Failed tasks will be retried according to the retry configuration.
 *  `503` (Service Unavailable) is considered an App Engine system error instead
 *  of an application error and will cause Cloud Tasks' traffic congestion
 *  control to temporarily throttle the queue's dispatches. Unlike other types
 *  of task targets, a `429` (Too Many Requests) response from an app handler
 *  does not cause traffic congestion control to throttle the queue.
