/**
 *  Firebase App Check is enforced for the service. The service will reject any
 *  request that attempts to access your project's resources if it does not have
 *  valid App Check token attached, with some exceptions depending on the
 *  service; for example, some services will still allow requests bearing the
 *  developer's privileged service account credentials without an App Check
 *  token. App Check metrics continue to be collected to help you detect issues
 *  with your App Check integration and monitor the composition of your callers.
 *  While the service is protected by App Check, other applicable protections,
 *  such as user authorization, continue to be enforced at the same time. Use
 *  caution when choosing to enforce App Check on a Firebase service. If your
 *  users have not updated to an App Check capable version of your app, their
 *  apps will no longer be able to use your Firebase services that are enforcing
 *  App Check. App Check metrics can help you decide whether to enforce App
 *  Check on your Firebase services. If your app has not launched yet, you
 *  should enable enforcement immediately, since there are no outdated clients
 *  in use.

 *        Firebase App Check is enforced for the service. The service will
 *        reject any request that attempts to access your project's resources if
 *        it does not have valid App Check token attached, with some exceptions
 *        depending on the service; for example, some services will still allow
 *        requests bearing the developer's privileged service account
 *        credentials without an App Check token. App Check metrics continue to
 *        be collected to help you detect issues with your App Check integration
 *        and monitor the composition of your callers. While the service is
 *        protected by App Check, other applicable protections, such as user
 *        authorization, continue to be enforced at the same time. Use caution
 *        when choosing to enforce App Check on a Firebase service. If your
 *        users have not updated to an App Check capable version of your app,
 *        their apps will no longer be able to use your Firebase services that
 *        are enforcing App Check. App Check metrics can help you decide whether
 *        to enforce App Check on your Firebase services. If your app has not
 *        launched yet, you should enable enforcement immediately, since there
 *        are no outdated clients in use. (Value: "ENFORCED")
 *    @arg @c kGTLRFirebaseappcheck_GoogleFirebaseAppcheckV1Service_EnforcementMode_Off
 *        Firebase App Check is not enforced for the service, nor are App Check
 *        metrics collected. Though the service is not protected by App Check in
 *        this mode, other applicable protections, such as user authorization,
 *        are still enforced. An unconfigured service is in this mode by
 *        default. (Value: "OFF")
 *    @arg @c kGTLRFirebaseappcheck_GoogleFirebaseAppcheckV1Service_EnforcementMode_Unenforced
 *        Firebase App Check is not enforced for the service. App Check metrics
 *        are collected to help you decide when to turn on enforcement for the
 *        service. Though the service is not protected by App Check in this
 *        mode, other applicable protections, such as user authorization, are
 *        still enforced. (Value: "UNENFORCED")
