/**
 *  Determines whether the specified (directional) relationship exists between
 *  the specified source and target assets.
 *  The relation describes the intent of the link between the two assets as
 *  claimed by the source asset. An example for such relationships is the
 *  delegation of privileges or permissions.
 *  This command is most often used by infrastructure systems to check
 *  preconditions for an action. For example, a client may want to know if it
 *  is OK to send a web URL to a particular mobile app instead. The client can
 *  check for the relevant asset link from the website to the mobile app to
 *  decide if the operation should be allowed.
 *  A note about security: if you specify a secure asset as the source, such as
 *  an HTTPS website or an Android app, the API will ensure that any
 *  statements used to generate the response have been made in a secure way by
 *  the owner of that asset. Conversely, if the source asset is an insecure
 *  HTTP website (that is, the URL starts with `http://` instead of `https://`),
 *  the API cannot verify its statements securely, and it is not possible to
 *  ensure that the website's statements have not been altered by a third
 *  party. For more information, see the [Digital Asset Links technical design
