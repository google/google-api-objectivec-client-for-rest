/**
 *  Defines an Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy. It is used to
 *  specify access control policies for Cloud Platform resources.
 *  A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
 *  `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service
 *  accounts,
 *  Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
 *  permissions (defined by IAM or configured by users). A `binding` can
 *  optionally specify a `condition`, which is a logic expression that further
 *  constrains the role binding based on attributes about the request and/or
 *  target resource.
 *  **JSON Example**
 *  {
 *  "bindings": [
 *  {
 *  "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin",
 *  "members": [
 *  "user:mike\@example.com",
 *  "group:admins\@example.com",
 *  "domain:google.com",
 *  "serviceAccount:my-project-id\@appspot.gserviceaccount.com"
 *  ]
 *  },
 *  {
 *  "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer",
 *  "members": ["user:eve\@example.com"],
 *  "condition": {
 *  "title": "expirable access",
 *  "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020",
 *  "expression": "request.time <
 *  timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')",
 *  }
 *  }
 *  ]
 *  }
 *  **YAML Example**
 *  bindings:
 *  - members:
 *  - user:mike\@example.com
 *  - group:admins\@example.com
 *  - domain:google.com
 *  - serviceAccount:my-project-id\@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
 *  role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin
 *  - members:
 *  - user:eve\@example.com
 *  role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer
 *  condition:
 *  title: expirable access
 *  description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020
 *  expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')
