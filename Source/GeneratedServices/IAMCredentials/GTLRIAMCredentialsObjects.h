/**
 *  Required. Input token.
 *  Must be in JWT format according to
 *  RFC7523 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7523)
 *  and must have 'kid' field in the header.
 *  Supported signing algorithms: RS256 (RS512, ES256, ES512 coming soon).
 *  Mandatory payload fields (along the lines of RFC 7523, section 3):
 *  - iss: issuer of the token. Must provide a discovery document at
 *  $iss/.well-known/openid-configuration . The document needs to be
 *  formatted according to section 4.2 of the OpenID Connect Discovery
 *  1.0 specification.
 *  - iat: Issue time in seconds since epoch. Must be in the past.
 *  - exp: Expiration time in seconds since epoch. Must be less than 48 hours
 *  after iat. We recommend to create tokens that last shorter than 6
 *  hours to improve security unless business reasons mandate longer
 *  expiration times. Shorter token lifetimes are generally more secure
 *  since tokens that have been exfiltrated by attackers can be used for
 *  a shorter time. you can configure the maximum lifetime of the
 *  incoming token in the configuration of the mapper.
 *  The resulting Google token will expire within an hour or at "exp",
 *  whichever is earlier.
 *  - sub: JWT subject, identity asserted in the JWT.
 *  - aud: Configured in the mapper policy. By default the service account
 *  email.
 *  Claims from the incoming token can be transferred into the output token
 *  accoding to the mapper configuration. The outgoing claim size is limited.
 *  Outgoing claims size must be less than 4kB serialized as JSON without
 *  whitespace.
 *  Example header:
 *  {
 *  "alg": "RS256",
 *  "kid": "92a4265e14ab04d4d228a48d10d4ca31610936f8"
 *  }
 *  Example payload:
 *  {
 *  "iss": "https://accounts.google.com",
 *  "iat": 1517963104,
 *  "exp": 1517966704,
 *  "aud":
