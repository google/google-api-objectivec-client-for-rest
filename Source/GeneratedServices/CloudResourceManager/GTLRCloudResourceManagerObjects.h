 *  `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with:
 *  {enforced: true}
 *  The constraint at `organizations/foo` is not enforced.

 *  Example 3 (RestoreDefault):
 *  `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with:
 *  {enforced: true}
 *  `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with:
 *  {RestoreDefault: {}}
 *  The constraint at `organizations/foo` is enforced.

/**
 *  Determines the inheritance behavior for this `Policy`.
 *  By default, a `ListPolicy` set at a resource supercedes any `Policy` set

 *  set to `true`, then the values from the effective `Policy` of the parent
 *  resource are inherited, meaning the values set in this `Policy` are
 *  added to the values inherited up the hierarchy.
 *  Setting `Policy` hierarchies that inherit both allowed values and denied
 *  values isn't recommended in most circumstances to keep the configuration
 *  simple and understandable. However, it is possible to set a `Policy` with
 *  `allowed_values` set that inherits a `Policy` with `denied_values` set.
 *  In this case, the values that are allowed must be in `allowed_values` and
 *  not present in `denied_values`.
 *  For example, suppose you have a `Constraint`
 *  `constraints/serviceuser.services`, which has a `constraint_type` of
 *  `list_constraint`, and with `constraint_default` set to `ALLOW`.
 *  Suppose that at the Organization level, a `Policy` is applied that
 *  restricts the allowed API activations to {`E1`, `E2`}. Then, if a
 *  `Policy` is applied to a project below the Organization that has
 *  `inherit_from_parent` set to `false` and field all_values set to DENY,
 *  then an attempt to activate any API will be denied.
 *  The following examples demonstrate different possible layerings:
 *  Example 1 (no inherited values):
 *  `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values:
 *  {allowed_values: “E1” allowed_values:”E2”}
 *  ``projects/bar`` has `inherit_from_parent` `false` and values:
 *  {allowed_values: "E3" allowed_values: "E4"}
 *  The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`.
 *  The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `E3`, and `E4`.
 *  Example 2 (inherited values):
 *  `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values:
 *  {allowed_values: “E1” allowed_values:”E2”}
 *  `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with values:
 *  {value: “E3” value: ”E4” inherit_from_parent: true}
 *  The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`.
 *  The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `E1`, `E2`, `E3`, and `E4`.
 *  Example 3 (inheriting both allowed and denied values):
 *  `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values:
 *  {allowed_values: "E1" allowed_values: "E2"}
 *  `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with:
 *  {denied_values: "E1"}
 *  The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`.
 *  The value accepted at `projects/bar` is `E2`.
 *  Example 4 (RestoreDefault):
 *  `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values:
 *  {allowed_values: “E1” allowed_values:”E2”}
 *  `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with values:
 *  {RestoreDefault: {}}
 *  The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`.
 *  The accepted values at `projects/bar` are either all or none depending on
 *  the value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if
 *  `DENY`, none).
 *  Example 5 (no policy inherits parent policy):
 *  `organizations/foo` has no `Policy` set.
 *  `projects/bar` has no `Policy` set.
 *  The accepted values at both levels are either all or none depending on
 *  the value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if
 *  `DENY`, none).
 *  Example 6 (ListConstraint allowing all):
 *  `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values:
 *  {allowed_values: “E1” allowed_values: ”E2”}
 *  `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with:
 *  {all: ALLOW}
 *  The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, E2`.
 *  Any value is accepted at `projects/bar`.
 *  Example 7 (ListConstraint allowing none):
 *  `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values:
 *  {allowed_values: “E1” allowed_values: ”E2”}
 *  `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with:
 *  {all: DENY}

/**
 *  The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for
 *  different
 *  programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by
 *  [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:
 *  - Simple to use and understand for most users
 *  - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs
 *  # Overview
 *  The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error
 *  message,
 *  and error details. The error code should be an enum value of
 *  google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if needed. The
 *  error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps
 *  developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing
 *  error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or
 *  localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary
 *  information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types
 *  in the package `google.rpc` that can be used for common error conditions.
 *  # Language mapping
 *  The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but
 *  it
 *  is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is
 *  exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can
 *  be
 *  mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
 *  in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.
 *  # Other uses
 *  The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of
 *  environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
 *  consistent developer experience across different environments.
 *  Example uses of this error model include:
 *  - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
 *  it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
 *  errors.
 *  - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
 *  have a `Status` message for error reporting.
 *  - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
 *  `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for
 *  each error sub-response.
 *  - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
 *  results in its response, the status of those operations should be
 *  represented directly using the `Status` message.
 *  - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could
 *  be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.
