/**
 *  The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for
 *  different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is
 *  used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:
 *  - Simple to use and understand for most users - Flexible enough to meet
 *  unexpected needs # Overview The `Status` message contains three pieces of
 *  data: error code, error message, and error details. The error code should be
 *  an enum value of google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes
 *  if needed. The error message should be a developer-facing English message
 *  that helps developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized
 *  user-facing error message is needed, put the localized message in the error
 *  details or localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain
 *  arbitrary information about the error. There is a predefined set of error
 *  detail types in the package `google.rpc` which can be used for common error
 *  conditions. # Language mapping The `Status` message is the logical
 *  representation of the error model, but it is not necessarily the actual wire
 *  format. When the `Status` message is exposed in different client libraries
 *  and different wire protocols, it can be mapped differently. For example, it
 *  will likely be mapped to some exceptions in Java, but more likely mapped to
 *  some error codes in C. # Other uses The error model and the `Status` message
 *  can be used in a variety of environments, either with or without APIs, to
 *  provide a consistent developer experience across different environments.
 *  Example uses of this error model include: - Partial errors. If a service
 *  needs to return partial errors to the client, it may embed the `Status` in
 *  the normal response to indicate the partial errors. - Workflow errors. A
 *  typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may have a `Status` message
 *  for error reporting purpose. - Batch operations. If a client uses batch
 *  request and batch response, the `Status` message should be used directly
 *  inside batch response, one for each error sub-response. - Asynchronous
 *  operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation results in its
 *  response, the status of those operations should be represented directly
 *  using the `Status` message. - Logging. If some API errors are stored in
 *  logs, the message `Status` could be used directly after any stripping needed
 *  for security/privacy reasons.
