/**
 *  Defines an Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy. It is used to

 *  A `Policy` consists of a list of `bindings`. A `binding` binds a list of
 *  `members` to a `role`, where the members can be user accounts, Google
 *  groups,
 *  Google domains, and service accounts. A `role` is a named list of
 *  permissions
 *  defined by IAM.
 *  **JSON Example**
 *  {
 *  "bindings": [
 *  {
 *  "role": "roles/owner",
 *  "members": [
 *  "user:mike\@example.com",
 *  "group:admins\@example.com",

 *  ]

 *  {
 *  "role": "roles/viewer",

 *  **YAML Example**
 *  bindings:
 *  - members:
 *  - user:mike\@example.com
 *  - group:admins\@example.com
 *  - domain:google.com
 *  - serviceAccount:my-other-app\@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
