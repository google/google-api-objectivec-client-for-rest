/**
 *  `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a
 *  URL that describes the type of the serialized message.
 *  Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form of
 *  utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.
 *  Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.
 *  Foo foo = ...; Any any; any.PackFrom(foo); ... if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) { ...
 *  }
 *  Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.
 *  Foo foo = ...; Any any = Any.pack(foo); ... if (any.is(Foo.class)) { foo =
 *  any.unpack(Foo.class); }
 *  Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.
 *  foo = Foo(...) any = Any() any.Pack(foo) ... if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
 *  any.Unpack(foo) ...
 *  The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
 *  'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack methods
 *  only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/' in the type URL,
 *  for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type name "y.z".
 *  JSON ==== The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular
 *  representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an additional
 *  field `\@type` which contains the type URL. Example:
 *  package google.profile; message Person { string first_name = 1; string
 *  last_name = 2; }
 *  { "\@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person", "firstName": ,
 *  "lastName": }
 *  If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
 *  representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field `value`
 *  which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `\@type` field. Example (for
 *  message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):
 *  { "\@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration", "value":
 *  "1.212s" }

 *  URL's path must represent the fully qualified name of the type (as in
 *  `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form
 *  (e.g., leading "." is not accepted). * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
 *  [google.protobuf.Type][] value in binary format, or produce an error. *
 *  Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the URL, or have
 *  them precompiled into a binary to avoid any lookup. Therefore, binary
 *  compatibility needs to be preserved on changes to types. (Use versioned type

/**
 *  The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for
 *  different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is
 *  used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:
 *  - Simple to use and understand for most users - Flexible enough to meet
 *  unexpected needs
 *  # Overview
 *  The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error
 *  message, and error details. The error code should be an enum value of
 *  [google.rpc.Code][], but it may accept additional error codes if needed. The
 *  error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps
 *  developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing
 *  error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or
 *  localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary
 *  information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types
 *  in the package `google.rpc` which can be used for common error conditions.
 *  # Language mapping
 *  The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but
 *  it is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is
 *  exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can
 *  be mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some
 *  exceptions in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.
 *  # Other uses
 *  The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of
 *  environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a consistent developer
 *  experience across different environments.
 *  Example uses of this error model include:
 *  - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
 *  it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
 *  errors.
 *  - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may have
 *  a `Status` message for error reporting purpose.
 *  - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
 *  `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for each
 *  error sub-response.
 *  - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
 *  results in its response, the status of those operations should be
 *  represented directly using the `Status` message.
 *  - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could
 *  be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.

/**
 *  A Timestamp represents a point in time independent of any time zone or

 *  "smeared" so that no leap second table is needed for interpretation. Range

 *  restricting to that range, we ensure that we can convert to and from RFC
 *  3339 date strings. See
 *  [https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt).
 *  Example 1: Compute Timestamp from POSIX `time()`.

 *  FILETIME ft; GetSystemTimeAsFileTime(&ft); UINT64 ticks =
 *  (((UINT64)ft.dwHighDateTime) << 32) | ft.dwLowDateTime;

 *  11644473600LL)); timestamp.set_nanos((INT32) ((ticks % 10000000) * 100));

 *  long millis = System.currentTimeMillis();
 *  Timestamp timestamp = Timestamp.newBuilder().setSeconds(millis / 1000)
 *  .setNanos((int) ((millis % 1000) * 1000000)).build();
