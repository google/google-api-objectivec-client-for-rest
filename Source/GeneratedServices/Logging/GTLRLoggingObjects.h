/**
 *  The units in which the metric value is reported. It is only applicable if
 *  the value_type is INT64, DOUBLE, or DISTRIBUTION. The unit defines the
 *  representation of the stored metric values.Different systems may scale the
 *  values to be more easily displayed (so a value of 0.02KBy might be displayed
 *  as 20By, and a value of 3523KBy might be displayed as 3.5MBy). However, if
 *  the unit is KBy, then the value of the metric is always in thousands of
 *  bytes, no matter how it may be displayed..If you want a custom metric to
 *  record the exact number of CPU-seconds used by a job, you can create an
 *  INT64 CUMULATIVE metric whose unit is s{CPU} (or equivalently 1s{CPU} or
 *  just s). If the job uses 12,005 CPU-seconds, then the value is written as
 *  12005.Alternatively, if you want a custom metric to record data in a more
 *  granular way, you can create a DOUBLE CUMULATIVE metric whose unit is
 *  ks{CPU}, and then write the value 12.005 (which is 12005/1000), or use
 *  Kis{CPU} and write 11.723 (which is 12005/1024).The supported units are a
 *  subset of The Unified Code for Units of Measure
 *  (http://unitsofmeasure.org/ucum.html) standard:Basic units (UNIT) bit bit By

 *  tebi (2^40) Pi pebi (2^50)GrammarThe grammar also includes these connectors:
 *  / division or ratio (as an infix operator). For examples, kBy/{email} or
 *  MiBy/10ms (although you should almost never have /s in a metric unit; rates
 *  should always be computed at query time from the underlying cumulative or
 *  delta value). . multiplication or composition (as an infix operator). For
 *  examples, GBy.d or k{watt}.h.The grammar for a unit is as follows:
 *  Expression = Component { "." Component } { "/" Component } ; Component = ( [
 *  PREFIX ] UNIT | "%" ) [ Annotation ] | Annotation | "1" ; Annotation = "{"
 *  NAME "}" ; Notes: Annotation is just a comment if it follows a UNIT. If the
 *  annotation is used alone, then the unit is equivalent to 1. For examples,
 *  {request}/s == 1/s, By{transmitted}/s == By/s. NAME is a sequence of
 *  non-blank printable ASCII characters not containing { or }. 1 represents a
 *  unitary dimensionless unit
 *  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_quantity) of 1, such as in 1/s.
 *  It is typically used when none of the basic units are appropriate. For
 *  example, "new users per day" can be represented as 1/d or {new-users}/d (and
 *  a metric value 5 would mean "5 new users). Alternatively, "thousands of page
 *  views per day" would be represented as 1000/d or k1/d or k{page_views}/d
 *  (and a metric value of 5.3 would mean "5300 page views per day"). %
 *  represents dimensionless value of 1/100, and annotates values giving a
 *  percentage (so the metric values are typically in the range of 0..100, and a
 *  metric value 3 means "3 percent"). 10^2.% indicates a metric contains a
 *  ratio, typically in the range 0..1, that will be multiplied by 100 and
 *  displayed as a percentage (so a metric value 0.03 means "3 percent").
