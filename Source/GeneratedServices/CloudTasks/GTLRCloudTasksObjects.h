/**
 *  App Engine HTTP request.
 *  The message defines the HTTP request that is sent to an App Engine app when
 *  the task is dispatched.
 *  This proto can only be used for tasks in a queue which has
 *  app_engine_http_queue set.
 *  Using AppEngineHttpRequest requires
 *  [`appengine.applications.get`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/admin-api/access-control)
 *  Google IAM permission for the project
 *  and the following scope:
 *  `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform`
 *  The task will be delivered to the App Engine app which belongs to the same
 *  project as the queue. For more information, see
 *  [How Requests are
 *  Routed](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/how-requests-are-routed)
 *  and how routing is affected by
 *  [dispatch
 *  files](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/dispatchref).
 *  Traffic is encrypted during transport and never leaves Google datacenters.
 *  Because this traffic is carried over a communication mechanism internal to
 *  Google, you cannot explicitly set the protocol (for example, HTTP or HTTPS).
 *  The request to the handler, however, will appear to have used the HTTP
 *  protocol.
 *  The AppEngineRouting used to construct the URL that the task is
 *  delivered to can be set at the queue-level or task-level:
 *  * If set,
 *  app_engine_routing_override
 *  is used for all tasks in the queue, no matter what the setting
 *  is for the
 *  task-level app_engine_routing.
 *  The `url` that the task will be sent to is:
 *  * `url =` host `+`
 *  relative_uri
 *  Tasks can be dispatched to secure app handlers, unsecure app handlers, and
 *  URIs restricted with
 *  [`login:
 *  admin`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/appref).
 *  Because tasks are not run as any user, they cannot be dispatched to URIs
 *  restricted with
 *  [`login:
 *  required`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/appref)
 *  Task dispatches also do not follow redirects.
 *  The task attempt has succeeded if the app's request handler returns
 *  an HTTP response code in the range [`200` - `299`]. `503` is
 *  considered an App Engine system error instead of an application
 *  error. Requests returning error `503` will be retried regardless of
 *  retry configuration and not counted against retry counts.
 *  Any other response code or a failure to receive a response before the
 *  deadline is a failed attempt.

/**
 *  The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for
 *  different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is
 *  used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:
 *  - Simple to use and understand for most users
 *  - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs
 *  # Overview
 *  The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error
 *  message, and error details. The error code should be an enum value of
 *  google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if needed. The
 *  error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps
 *  developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing
 *  error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or
 *  localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary
 *  information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types
 *  in the package `google.rpc` that can be used for common error conditions.
 *  # Language mapping
 *  The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but
 *  it
 *  is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is
 *  exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can
 *  be
 *  mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
 *  in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.
 *  # Other uses
 *  The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of
 *  environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
 *  consistent developer experience across different environments.
 *  Example uses of this error model include:
 *  - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
 *  it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
 *  errors.
 *  - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
 *  have a `Status` message for error reporting.
 *  - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
 *  `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for
 *  each error sub-response.
 *  - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
 *  results in its response, the status of those operations should be
 *  represented directly using the `Status` message.
 *  - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could
 *  be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.

 *  of the service: 10 minutes for standard apps with automatic scaling, 24

 *  seconds, 24 hours 15 seconds]. Regardless of the task's
 *  `dispatch_deadline`, the app handler will not run for longer than than
 *  the service's timeout. We recommend setting the `dispatch_deadline` to
