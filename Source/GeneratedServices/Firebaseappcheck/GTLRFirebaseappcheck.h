// API:
//   Firebase App Check API (firebaseappcheck/v1beta)
// Description:
//   App Check works alongside other Firebase services to help protect your
//   backend resources from abuse, such as billing fraud or phishing. With App
//   Check, devices running your app will use an app or device attestation
//   provider that attests to one or both of the following: * Requests originate
//   from your authentic app * Requests originate from an authentic, untampered
//   device This attestation is attached to every request your app makes to your
//   Firebase backend resources. The Firebase App Check REST API allows you to
//   manage your App Check configurations programmatically. It also allows you
//   to exchange attestation material for App Check tokens directly without
//   using a Firebase SDK. Finally, it allows you to obtain the public key set
//   necessary to validate an App Check token yourself. [Learn more about App
//   Check](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-check).
