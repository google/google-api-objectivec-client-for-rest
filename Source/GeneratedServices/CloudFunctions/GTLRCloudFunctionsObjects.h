/**
 *  An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
 *  controls for Google Cloud resources.
 *  A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
 *  `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service
 *  accounts,
 *  Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
 *  permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
 *  custom role.
 *  Optionally, a `binding` can specify a `condition`, which is a logical
 *  expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates
 *  to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the
 *  request, the resource, or both.
 *  **JSON example:**
 *  {
 *  "bindings": [
 *  {
 *  "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin",
 *  "members": [
 *  "user:mike\@example.com",
 *  "group:admins\@example.com",
 *  "domain:google.com",
 *  "serviceAccount:my-project-id\@appspot.gserviceaccount.com"
 *  ]

 *  {
 *  "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer",
 *  "members": ["user:eve\@example.com"],
