 *  An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access

 *  permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
 *  custom role.

 *  expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates
 *  to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the
 *  request, the resource, or both.

 *  "members": [

 *  Endpoint configuration attributes that can be used to control different
 *  aspects of the message delivery.
 *  The only currently supported attribute is `x-goog-version`, which you can
 *  use to change the format of the pushed message. This attribute
 *  indicates the version of the data expected by the endpoint. This
 *  controls the shape of the pushed message (i.e., its fields and metadata).
 *  If not present during the `CreateSubscription` call, it will default to
 *  the version of the Pub/Sub API used to make such call. If not present in a
 *  `ModifyPushConfig` call, its value will not be changed. `GetSubscription`
 *  calls will always return a valid version, even if the subscription was
 *  created without this attribute.
 *  The only supported values for the `x-goog-version` attribute are:
 *  * `v1beta1`: uses the push format defined in the v1beta1 Pub/Sub API.
 *  * `v1` or `v1beta2`: uses the push format defined in the v1 Pub/Sub API.
 *  For example:
 *  <pre><code>attributes { "x-goog-version": "v1" } </code></pre>
