/**
 *  KeyRange represents a range of rows in a table or index.
 *  A range has a start key and an end key. These keys can be open or
 *  closed, indicating if the range includes rows with that key.
 *  Keys are represented by lists, where the ith value in the list
 *  corresponds to the ith component of the table or index primary key.
 *  Individual values are encoded as described here.
 *  For example, consider the following table definition:
 *  CREATE TABLE UserEvents (
 *  UserName STRING(MAX),
 *  EventDate STRING(10)
 *  ) PRIMARY KEY(UserName, EventDate);
 *  The following keys name rows in this table:
 *  "Bob", "2014-09-23"
 *  Since the `UserEvents` table's `PRIMARY KEY` clause names two
 *  columns, each `UserEvents` key has two elements; the first is the
 *  `UserName`, and the second is the `EventDate`.
 *  Key ranges with multiple components are interpreted
 *  lexicographically by component using the table or index key's declared
 *  sort order. For example, the following range returns all events for
 *  user `"Bob"` that occurred in the year 2015:
 *  "start_closed": ["Bob", "2015-01-01"]
 *  "end_closed": ["Bob", "2015-12-31"]
 *  Start and end keys can omit trailing key components. This affects the
 *  inclusion and exclusion of rows that exactly match the provided key
 *  components: if the key is closed, then rows that exactly match the
 *  provided components are included; if the key is open, then rows
 *  that exactly match are not included.
 *  For example, the following range includes all events for `"Bob"` that
 *  occurred during and after the year 2000:
 *  "start_closed": ["Bob", "2000-01-01"]
 *  "end_closed": ["Bob"]
 *  The next example retrieves all events for `"Bob"`:
 *  "start_closed": ["Bob"]
 *  "end_closed": ["Bob"]
 *  To retrieve events before the year 2000:
 *  "start_closed": ["Bob"]
 *  "end_open": ["Bob", "2000-01-01"]
 *  The following range includes all rows in the table:
 *  "start_closed": []
 *  "end_closed": []
 *  This range returns all users whose `UserName` begins with any
 *  character from A to C:
 *  "start_closed": ["A"]
 *  "end_open": ["D"]
 *  This range returns all users whose `UserName` begins with B:
 *  "start_closed": ["B"]
 *  "end_open": ["C"]
 *  Key ranges honor column sort order. For example, suppose a table is
 *  defined as follows:
 *  CREATE TABLE DescendingSortedTable {
 *  Key INT64,
 *  ...
 *  ) PRIMARY KEY(Key DESC);
 *  The following range retrieves all rows with key values between 1
 *  and 100 inclusive:
 *  "start_closed": ["100"]
 *  "end_closed": ["1"]
 *  Note that 100 is passed as the start, and 1 is passed as the end,

 *  row, where N is equal to the number of entries in
 *  metadata.row_type.fields.
 *  Most values are encoded based on type as described
 *  here.
 *  It is possible that the last value in values is "chunked",
 *  meaning that the rest of the value is sent in subsequent
 *  `PartialResultSet`(s). This is denoted by the chunked_value
 *  field. Two or more chunked values can be merged to form a
 *  complete value as follows:
 *  * `bool/number/null`: cannot be chunked
 *  * `string`: concatenate the strings
 *  * `list`: concatenate the lists. If the last element in a list is a
 *  `string`, `list`, or `object`, merge it with the first element in
 *  the next list by applying these rules recursively.
 *  * `object`: concatenate the (field name, field value) pairs. If a
 *  field name is duplicated, then apply these rules recursively
 *  to merge the field values.
 *  Some examples of merging:
 *  # Strings are concatenated.
 *  "foo", "bar" => "foobar"
 *  # Lists of non-strings are concatenated.
 *  [2, 3], [4] => [2, 3, 4]
 *  # Lists are concatenated, but the last and first elements are merged
 *  # because they are strings.
 *  ["a", "b"], ["c", "d"] => ["a", "bc", "d"]
 *  # Lists are concatenated, but the last and first elements are merged
 *  # because they are lists. Recursively, the last and first elements
 *  # of the inner lists are merged because they are strings.
 *  ["a", ["b", "c"]], [["d"], "e"] => ["a", ["b", "cd"], "e"]
 *  # Non-overlapping object fields are combined.
 *  {"a": "1"}, {"b": "2"} => {"a": "1", "b": 2"}
 *  # Overlapping object fields are merged.
 *  {"a": "1"}, {"a": "2"} => {"a": "12"}
 *  # Examples of merging objects containing lists of strings.
 *  {"a": ["1"]}, {"a": ["2"]} => {"a": ["12"]}
 *  For a more complete example, suppose a streaming SQL query is
 *  yielding a result set whose rows contain a single string
 *  field. The following `PartialResultSet`s might be yielded:
 *  {
 *  "metadata": { ... }
 *  "values": ["Hello", "W"]
 *  "chunked_value": true
 *  "resume_token": "Af65..."
 *  }
 *  {

 *  "chunked_value": true
 *  "resume_token": "Bqp2..."
 *  }
 *  {
 *  "values": ["d"]
 *  "resume_token": "Zx1B..."
 *  }
 *  This sequence of `PartialResultSet`s encodes two rows, one
 *  containing the field value `"Hello"`, and a second containing the
 *  field value `"World" = "W" + "orl" + "d"`.
 *
 *  Can be any valid JSON type.

 *  developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing
 *  error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or
 *  localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary
 *  information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types
 *  in the package `google.rpc` which can be used for common error conditions.
 *  # Language mapping
 *  The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but
 *  it
 *  is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is
 *  exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can
 *  be
 *  mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
 *  in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.
 *  # Other uses
 *  The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of
 *  environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
 *  consistent developer experience across different environments.
 *  Example uses of this error model include:
 *  - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
 *  it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
 *  errors.
 *  - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
 *  have a `Status` message for error reporting purpose.
 *  - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
 *  `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for
 *  each error sub-response.
 *  - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
 *  results in its response, the status of those operations should be
 *  represented directly using the `Status` message.
 *  - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could
 *  be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.

/**
 *  # Transactions
 *  Each session can have at most one active transaction at a time. After the
 *  active transaction is completed, the session can immediately be
 *  re-used for the next transaction. It is not necessary to create a
 *  new session for each transaction.
 *  # Transaction Modes
 *  Cloud Spanner supports two transaction modes:
 *  1. Locking read-write. This type of transaction is the only way
 *  to write data into Cloud Spanner. These transactions rely on
 *  pessimistic locking and, if necessary, two-phase commit.
 *  Locking read-write transactions may abort, requiring the
 *  application to retry.
 *  2. Snapshot read-only. This transaction type provides guaranteed
 *  consistency across several reads, but does not allow
 *  writes. Snapshot read-only transactions can be configured to
 *  read at timestamps in the past. Snapshot read-only
 *  transactions do not need to be committed.
 *  For transactions that only read, snapshot read-only transactions
 *  provide simpler semantics and are almost always faster. In
 *  particular, read-only transactions do not take locks, so they do
 *  not conflict with read-write transactions. As a consequence of not
 *  taking locks, they also do not abort, so retry loops are not needed.
 *  Transactions may only read/write data in a single database. They
 *  may, however, read/write data in different tables within that
 *  database.
 *  ## Locking Read-Write Transactions
 *  Locking transactions may be used to atomically read-modify-write
 *  data anywhere in a database. This type of transaction is externally
 *  consistent.
 *  Clients should attempt to minimize the amount of time a transaction
 *  is active. Faster transactions commit with higher probability
 *  and cause less contention. Cloud Spanner attempts to keep read locks
 *  active as long as the transaction continues to do reads, and the
 *  transaction has not been terminated by
 *  Commit or
 *  Rollback. Long periods of
 *  inactivity at the client may cause Cloud Spanner to release a
 *  transaction's locks and abort it.
 *  Reads performed within a transaction acquire locks on the data
 *  being read. Writes can only be done at commit time, after all reads
 *  have been completed.
 *  Conceptually, a read-write transaction consists of zero or more
 *  reads or SQL queries followed by
 *  Commit. At any time before
 *  Commit, the client can send a
 *  Rollback request to abort the
 *  transaction.
 *  ### Semantics
 *  Cloud Spanner can commit the transaction if all read locks it acquired
 *  are still valid at commit time, and it is able to acquire write
 *  locks for all writes. Cloud Spanner can abort the transaction for any
 *  reason. If a commit attempt returns `ABORTED`, Cloud Spanner guarantees
 *  that the transaction has not modified any user data in Cloud Spanner.
 *  Unless the transaction commits, Cloud Spanner makes no guarantees about
 *  how long the transaction's locks were held for. It is an error to
 *  use Cloud Spanner locks for any sort of mutual exclusion other than
 *  between Cloud Spanner transactions themselves.
 *  ### Retrying Aborted Transactions
 *  When a transaction aborts, the application can choose to retry the
 *  whole transaction again. To maximize the chances of successfully
 *  committing the retry, the client should execute the retry in the
 *  same session as the original attempt. The original session's lock
 *  priority increases with each consecutive abort, meaning that each
 *  attempt has a slightly better chance of success than the previous.
 *  Under some circumstances (e.g., many transactions attempting to
 *  modify the same row(s)), a transaction can abort many times in a
 *  short period before successfully committing. Thus, it is not a good
 *  idea to cap the number of retries a transaction can attempt;
 *  instead, it is better to limit the total amount of wall time spent
 *  retrying.
 *  ### Idle Transactions
 *  A transaction is considered idle if it has no outstanding reads or
 *  SQL queries and has not started a read or SQL query within the last 10
 *  seconds. Idle transactions can be aborted by Cloud Spanner so that they
 *  don't hold on to locks indefinitely. In that case, the commit will
 *  fail with error `ABORTED`.
 *  If this behavior is undesirable, periodically executing a simple
 *  SQL query in the transaction (e.g., `SELECT 1`) prevents the
 *  transaction from becoming idle.
 *  ## Snapshot Read-Only Transactions
 *  Snapshot read-only transactions provides a simpler method than
 *  locking read-write transactions for doing several consistent
 *  reads. However, this type of transaction does not support writes.
 *  Snapshot transactions do not take locks. Instead, they work by
 *  choosing a Cloud Spanner timestamp, then executing all reads at that
 *  timestamp. Since they do not acquire locks, they do not block
 *  concurrent read-write transactions.
 *  Unlike locking read-write transactions, snapshot read-only
 *  transactions never abort. They can fail if the chosen read
 *  timestamp is garbage collected; however, the default garbage
 *  collection policy is generous enough that most applications do not
 *  need to worry about this in practice.
 *  Snapshot read-only transactions do not need to call
 *  Commit or
 *  Rollback (and in fact are not
 *  permitted to do so).
 *  To execute a snapshot transaction, the client specifies a timestamp
 *  bound, which tells Cloud Spanner how to choose a read timestamp.
 *  The types of timestamp bound are:
 *  - Strong (the default).
 *  - Bounded staleness.
 *  - Exact staleness.
 *  If the Cloud Spanner database to be read is geographically distributed,
 *  stale read-only transactions can execute more quickly than strong
 *  or read-write transaction, because they are able to execute far
 *  from the leader replica.
 *  Each type of timestamp bound is discussed in detail below.
 *  ### Strong
 *  Strong reads are guaranteed to see the effects of all transactions
 *  that have committed before the start of the read. Furthermore, all
 *  rows yielded by a single read are consistent with each other -- if
 *  any part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read
 *  see the transaction.
 *  Strong reads are not repeatable: two consecutive strong read-only
 *  transactions might return inconsistent results if there are
 *  concurrent writes. If consistency across reads is required, the
 *  reads should be executed within a transaction or at an exact read
 *  timestamp.
 *  See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong.
 *  ### Exact Staleness
 *  These timestamp bounds execute reads at a user-specified
 *  timestamp. Reads at a timestamp are guaranteed to see a consistent
 *  prefix of the global transaction history: they observe
 *  modifications done by all transactions with a commit timestamp <=
 *  the read timestamp, and observe none of the modifications done by
 *  transactions with a larger commit timestamp. They will block until
 *  all conflicting transactions that may be assigned commit timestamps
 *  <= the read timestamp have finished.
 *  The timestamp can either be expressed as an absolute Cloud Spanner commit
 *  timestamp or a staleness relative to the current time.
 *  These modes do not require a "negotiation phase" to pick a
 *  timestamp. As a result, they execute slightly faster than the
 *  equivalent boundedly stale concurrency modes. On the other hand,
 *  boundedly stale reads usually return fresher results.
 *  See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.read_timestamp and
 *  TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.exact_staleness.
 *  ### Bounded Staleness
 *  Bounded staleness modes allow Cloud Spanner to pick the read timestamp,
 *  subject to a user-provided staleness bound. Cloud Spanner chooses the
 *  newest timestamp within the staleness bound that allows execution
 *  of the reads at the closest available replica without blocking.
 *  All rows yielded are consistent with each other -- if any part of
 *  the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read see the
 *  transaction. Boundedly stale reads are not repeatable: two stale
 *  reads, even if they use the same staleness bound, can execute at
 *  different timestamps and thus return inconsistent results.
 *  Boundedly stale reads execute in two phases: the first phase
 *  negotiates a timestamp among all replicas needed to serve the
 *  read. In the second phase, reads are executed at the negotiated
 *  timestamp.
 *  As a result of the two phase execution, bounded staleness reads are
 *  usually a little slower than comparable exact staleness
 *  reads. However, they are typically able to return fresher
 *  results, and are more likely to execute at the closest replica.
 *  Because the timestamp negotiation requires up-front knowledge of
 *  which rows will be read, it can only be used with single-use
 *  read-only transactions.
 *  See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.max_staleness and
 *  TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.min_read_timestamp.
 *  ### Old Read Timestamps and Garbage Collection
 *  Cloud Spanner continuously garbage collects deleted and overwritten data
 *  in the background to reclaim storage space. This process is known
 *  as "version GC". By default, version GC reclaims versions after they
 *  are one hour old. Because of this, Cloud Spanner cannot perform reads
 *  at read timestamps more than one hour in the past. This
 *  restriction also applies to in-progress reads and/or SQL queries whose
 *  timestamp become too old while executing. Reads and SQL queries with
 *  too-old read timestamps fail with the error `FAILED_PRECONDITION`.
