/**
 *  An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
 *  controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
 *  `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`.
 *  Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains
 *  (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can
 *  be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of
 *  Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is
 *  a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression
 *  evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of
 *  the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support
 *  conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
 *  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).
 *  **JSON example:** { "bindings": [ { "role":
 *  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
 *  "user:mike\@example.com", "group:admins\@example.com", "domain:google.com",
 *  "serviceAccount:my-project-id\@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role":
