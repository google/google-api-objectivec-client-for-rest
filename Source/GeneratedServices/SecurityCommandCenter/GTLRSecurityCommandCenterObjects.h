 *        Vulnerability: A critical vulnerability is easily discoverable by an
 *        external actor, exploitable, and results in the direct ability to
 *        execute arbitrary code, exfiltrate data, and otherwise gain additional
 *        access and privileges to cloud resources and workloads. Examples
 *        include publicly accessible unprotected user data, public SSH access
 *        with weak or no passwords, etc. Threat: Indicates a threat that is
 *        able to access, modify, or delete data or execute unauthorized code
 *        within existing resources. (Value: "CRITICAL")
 *    @arg @c kGTLRSecurityCommandCenter_Finding_Severity_High Vulnerability: A
 *        high risk vulnerability can be easily discovered and exploited in
 *        combination with other vulnerabilities in order to gain direct access
 *        and the ability to execute arbitrary code, exfiltrate data, and
 *        otherwise gain additional access and privileges to cloud resources and
 *        workloads. An example is a database with weak or no passwords that is
 *        only accessible internally. This database could easily be compromised
 *        by an actor that had access to the internal network. Threat: Indicates
 *        a threat that is able to create new computational resources in an
 *        environment but not able to access data or execute code in existing
 *        resources. (Value: "HIGH")
 *    @arg @c kGTLRSecurityCommandCenter_Finding_Severity_Low Vulnerability: A
 *        low risk vulnerability hampers a security organization’s ability to
 *        detect vulnerabilities or active threats in their deployment, or
 *        prevents the root cause investigation of security issues. An example
 *        is monitoring and logs being disabled for resource configurations and
 *        access. Threat: Indicates a threat that has obtained minimal access to
 *        an environment but is not able to access data, execute code, or create
 *        resources. (Value: "LOW")
 *    @arg @c kGTLRSecurityCommandCenter_Finding_Severity_Medium Vulnerability:
 *        A medium risk vulnerability could be used by an actor to gain access
 *        to resources or privileges that enable them to eventually (through
 *        multiple steps or a complex exploit) gain access and the ability to
 *        execute arbitrary code or exfiltrate data. An example is a service
 *        account with access to more projects than it should have. If an actor
 *        gains access to the service account, they could potentially use that
 *        access to manipulate a project the service account was not intended
 *        to. Threat: Indicates a threat that is able to cause operational
 *        impact but may not access data or execute unauthorized code. (Value:
 *        "MEDIUM")
 *    @arg @c kGTLRSecurityCommandCenter_Finding_Severity_SeverityUnspecified
