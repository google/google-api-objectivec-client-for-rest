/**
 *  An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access

 *  Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains
 *  (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can
 *  be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of
 *  Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is
 *  a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression
 *  evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of
 *  the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support

 *  **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field

 *  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).
