/**
 *  The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for
 *  different
 *  programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by
 *  [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:
 *  - Simple to use and understand for most users
 *  - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs
 *  # Overview
 *  The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error
 *  message,
 *  and error details. The error code should be an enum value of
 *  google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if needed. The
 *  error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps
 *  developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing
 *  error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or
 *  localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary
 *  information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types
 *  in the package `google.rpc` which can be used for common error conditions.
 *  # Language mapping
 *  The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but
 *  it
 *  is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is
 *  exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can
 *  be
 *  mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
 *  in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.
 *  # Other uses
 *  The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of
 *  environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
 *  consistent developer experience across different environments.
 *  Example uses of this error model include:
 *  - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
 *  it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
 *  errors.
 *  - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
 *  have a `Status` message for error reporting purpose.
 *  - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
 *  `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for
 *  each error sub-response.
 *  - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
 *  results in its response, the status of those operations should be
 *  represented directly using the `Status` message.
 *  - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could
 *  be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.
