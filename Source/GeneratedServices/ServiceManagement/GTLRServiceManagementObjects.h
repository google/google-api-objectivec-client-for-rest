/**
 *  # gRPC Transcoding
 *  gRPC Transcoding is a feature for mapping between a gRPC method and one or
 *  more HTTP REST endpoints. It allows developers to build a single API service
 *  that supports both gRPC APIs and REST APIs. Many systems, including [Google
 *  APIs](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis),
 *  [Cloud Endpoints](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints), [gRPC
 *  Gateway](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway),
 *  and [Envoy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy) proxy support this feature
 *  and use it for large scale production services.
 *  `HttpRule` defines the schema of the gRPC/REST mapping. The mapping
 *  specifies
 *  how different portions of the gRPC request message are mapped to the URL
 *  path, URL query parameters, and HTTP request body. It also controls how the
 *  gRPC response message is mapped to the HTTP response body. `HttpRule` is
 *  typically specified as an `google.api.http` annotation on the gRPC method.
 *  Each mapping specifies a URL path template and an HTTP method. The path
 *  template may refer to one or more fields in the gRPC request message, as
 *  long
 *  as each field is a non-repeated field with a primitive (non-message) type.
 *  The path template controls how fields of the request message are mapped to
 *  the URL path.
 *  Example:
 *  service Messaging {
 *  rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
 *  option (google.api.http) = {
 *  get: "/v1/{name=messages/ *}"
 *  };
 *  }
 *  }
 *  message GetMessageRequest {
 *  string name = 1; // Mapped to URL path.
 *  }
 *  message Message {
 *  string text = 1; // The resource content.
 *  }
 *  This enables an HTTP REST to gRPC mapping as below:
 *  HTTP | gRPC
 *  -----|-----
 *  `GET /v1/messages/123456` | `GetMessage(name: "messages/123456")`
 *  Any fields in the request message which are not bound by the path template
 *  automatically become HTTP query parameters if there is no HTTP request body.
 *  For example:
 *  service Messaging {
 *  rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
 *  option (google.api.http) = {
 *  get:"/v1/messages/{message_id}"
 *  };
 *  }
 *  }
 *  message GetMessageRequest {
 *  message SubMessage {
 *  string subfield = 1;
 *  }
 *  string message_id = 1; // Mapped to URL path.
 *  int64 revision = 2; // Mapped to URL query parameter `revision`.
 *  SubMessage sub = 3; // Mapped to URL query parameter `sub.subfield`.
 *  }
 *  This enables a HTTP JSON to RPC mapping as below:
 *  HTTP | gRPC
 *  -----|-----
 *  `GET /v1/messages/123456?revision=2&sub.subfield=foo` |
 *  `GetMessage(message_id: "123456" revision: 2 sub: SubMessage(subfield:
 *  "foo"))`
 *  Note that fields which are mapped to URL query parameters must have a
 *  primitive type or a repeated primitive type or a non-repeated message type.
 *  In the case of a repeated type, the parameter can be repeated in the URL
 *  as `...?param=A&param=B`. In the case of a message type, each field of the
 *  message is mapped to a separate parameter, such as
 *  `...?foo.a=A&foo.b=B&foo.c=C`.
 *  For HTTP methods that allow a request body, the `body` field
 *  specifies the mapping. Consider a REST update method on the
 *  message resource collection:
 *  service Messaging {
 *  rpc UpdateMessage(UpdateMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
 *  option (google.api.http) = {
 *  patch: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"
 *  body: "message"
 *  };
 *  }
 *  }
 *  message UpdateMessageRequest {
 *  string message_id = 1; // mapped to the URL
 *  Message message = 2; // mapped to the body
 *  }
 *  The following HTTP JSON to RPC mapping is enabled, where the
 *  representation of the JSON in the request body is determined by
 *  protos JSON encoding:
 *  HTTP | gRPC
 *  -----|-----
 *  `PATCH /v1/messages/123456 { "text": "Hi!" }` | `UpdateMessage(message_id:
 *  "123456" message { text: "Hi!" })`
 *  The special name `*` can be used in the body mapping to define that
 *  every field not bound by the path template should be mapped to the
 *  request body. This enables the following alternative definition of
 *  the update method:
 *  service Messaging {
 *  rpc UpdateMessage(Message) returns (Message) {
 *  option (google.api.http) = {
 *  patch: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"
 *  body: "*"
 *  };
 *  }
 *  }
 *  message Message {
 *  string message_id = 1;
 *  string text = 2;
 *  }
 *  The following HTTP JSON to RPC mapping is enabled:
 *  HTTP | gRPC
 *  -----|-----
 *  `PATCH /v1/messages/123456 { "text": "Hi!" }` | `UpdateMessage(message_id:
 *  "123456" text: "Hi!")`
 *  Note that when using `*` in the body mapping, it is not possible to
 *  have HTTP parameters, as all fields not bound by the path end in
 *  the body. This makes this option more rarely used in practice when
 *  defining REST APIs. The common usage of `*` is in custom methods
 *  which don't use the URL at all for transferring data.
 *  It is possible to define multiple HTTP methods for one RPC by using
 *  the `additional_bindings` option. Example:
 *  service Messaging {
 *  rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
 *  option (google.api.http) = {
 *  get: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"
 *  additional_bindings {
 *  get: "/v1/users/{user_id}/messages/{message_id}"
 *  }
 *  };
 *  }
 *  }
 *  message GetMessageRequest {
 *  string message_id = 1;
 *  string user_id = 2;
 *  }
 *  This enables the following two alternative HTTP JSON to RPC mappings:
 *  HTTP | gRPC
 *  -----|-----
 *  `GET /v1/messages/123456` | `GetMessage(message_id: "123456")`
 *  `GET /v1/users/me/messages/123456` | `GetMessage(user_id: "me" message_id:
 *  "123456")`
 *  ## Rules for HTTP mapping
 *  1. Leaf request fields (recursive expansion nested messages in the request
 *  message) are classified into three categories:
 *  - Fields referred by the path template. They are passed via the URL path.
 *  - Fields referred by the HttpRule.body. They are passed via the HTTP
 *  request body.
 *  - All other fields are passed via the URL query parameters, and the
 *  parameter name is the field path in the request message. A repeated
 *  field can be represented as multiple query parameters under the same
 *  name.
 *  2. If HttpRule.body is "*", there is no URL query parameter, all fields
 *  are passed via URL path and HTTP request body.
 *  3. If HttpRule.body is omitted, there is no HTTP request body, all
 *  fields are passed via URL path and URL query parameters.
 *  ### Path template syntax
 *  Template = "/" Segments [ Verb ] ;
 *  Segments = Segment { "/" Segment } ;
 *  Segment = "*" | "**" | LITERAL | Variable ;
 *  Variable = "{" FieldPath [ "=" Segments ] "}" ;
 *  FieldPath = IDENT { "." IDENT } ;
 *  Verb = ":" LITERAL ;
 *  The syntax `*` matches a single URL path segment. The syntax `**` matches
 *  zero or more URL path segments, which must be the last part of the URL path
 *  except the `Verb`.
 *  The syntax `Variable` matches part of the URL path as specified by its
 *  template. A variable template must not contain other variables. If a
 *  variable
 *  matches a single path segment, its template may be omitted, e.g. `{var}`
 *  is equivalent to `{var=*}`.
 *  The syntax `LITERAL` matches literal text in the URL path. If the `LITERAL`
 *  contains any reserved character, such characters should be percent-encoded
 *  before the matching.
 *  If a variable contains exactly one path segment, such as `"{var}"` or
 *  `"{var=*}"`, when such a variable is expanded into a URL path on the client
 *  side, all characters except `[-_.~0-9a-zA-Z]` are percent-encoded. The
 *  server side does the reverse decoding. Such variables show up in the
 *  [Discovery
 *  Document](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/reference/apis)
 *  as `{var}`.
 *  If a variable contains multiple path segments, such as `"{var=foo/ *}"`
 *  or `"{var=**}"`, when such a variable is expanded into a URL path on the
 *  client side, all characters except `[-_.~/0-9a-zA-Z]` are percent-encoded.
 *  The server side does the reverse decoding, except "%2F" and "%2f" are left
 *  unchanged. Such variables show up in the
 *  [Discovery
 *  Document](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/reference/apis)
 *  as `{+var}`.
 *  ## Using gRPC API Service Configuration
 *  gRPC API Service Configuration (service config) is a configuration language
 *  for configuring a gRPC service to become a user-facing product. The
 *  service config is simply the YAML representation of the `google.api.Service`
 *  proto message.
 *  As an alternative to annotating your proto file, you can configure gRPC
 *  transcoding in your service config YAML files. You do this by specifying a
 *  `HttpRule` that maps the gRPC method to a REST endpoint, achieving the same
 *  effect as the proto annotation. This can be particularly useful if you
 *  have a proto that is reused in multiple services. Note that any transcoding
 *  specified in the service config will override any matching transcoding
 *  configuration in the proto.
 *  Example:
 *  http:
 *  rules:
 *  # Selects a gRPC method and applies HttpRule to it.
 *  - selector: example.v1.Messaging.GetMessage
 *  get: /v1/messages/{message_id}/{sub.subfield}
 *  ## Special notes
 *  When gRPC Transcoding is used to map a gRPC to JSON REST endpoints, the
 *  proto to JSON conversion must follow the [proto3
 *  specification](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json).
 *  While the single segment variable follows the semantics of
 *  [RFC 6570](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570) Section 3.2.2 Simple String
 *  Expansion, the multi segment variable **does not** follow RFC 6570 Section
 *  3.2.3 Reserved Expansion. The reason is that the Reserved Expansion
 *  does not expand special characters like `?` and `#`, which would lead
 *  to invalid URLs. As the result, gRPC Transcoding uses a custom encoding
 *  for multi segment variables.
 *  The path variables **must not** refer to any repeated or mapped field,
 *  because client libraries are not capable of handling such variable
 *  expansion.
 *  The path variables **must not** capture the leading "/" character. The
 *  reason
 *  is that the most common use case "{var}" does not capture the leading "/"
 *  character. For consistency, all path variables must share the same behavior.
 *  Repeated message fields must not be mapped to URL query parameters, because
 *  no client library can support such complicated mapping.
 *  If an API needs to use a JSON array for request or response body, it can map
 *  the request or response body to a repeated field. However, some gRPC
 *  Transcoding implementations may not support this feature.

/**

 *  from the original method.
 *  - Each annotation belonging to the service config (http,
 *  visibility) which is not set in the redeclared method will be
 *  inherited.
 *  - If an http annotation is inherited, the path pattern will be
 *  modified as follows. Any version prefix will be replaced by the
 *  version of the including interface plus the root path if
 *  specified.
 *  Example of a simple mixin:
 *  package google.acl.v1;
 *  service AccessControl {
 *  // Get the underlying ACL object.
 *  rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl) {
 *  option (google.api.http).get = "/v1/{resource=**}:getAcl";

 *  // Get a data record.
 *  rpc GetData(GetDataRequest) returns (Data) {
 *  option (google.api.http).get = "/v2/{resource=**}";
 *  }
 *  }
 *  Example of a mixin configuration:
 *  apis:
 *  - name: google.storage.v2.Storage
 *  mixins:
 *  - name: google.acl.v1.AccessControl
 *  The mixin construct implies that all methods in `AccessControl` are
 *  also declared with same name and request/response types in
 *  `Storage`. A documentation generator or annotation processor will
 *  see the effective `Storage.GetAcl` method after inherting
 *  documentation and annotations as follows:
 *  service Storage {
 *  // Get the underlying ACL object.
 *  rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl) {
 *  option (google.api.http).get = "/v2/{resource=**}:getAcl";
 *  }
 *  ...
 *  }
 *  Note how the version in the path pattern changed from `v1` to `v2`.
 *  If the `root` field in the mixin is specified, it should be a
 *  relative path under which inherited HTTP paths are placed. Example:
 *  apis:
 *  - name: google.storage.v2.Storage
 *  mixins:
 *  - name: google.acl.v1.AccessControl
 *  root: acls
 *  This implies the following inherited HTTP annotation:

/**
 *  The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for
 *  different
 *  programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by
 *  [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:
 *  - Simple to use and understand for most users
 *  - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs
 *  # Overview
 *  The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error
 *  message,
 *  and error details. The error code should be an enum value of
 *  google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if needed. The
 *  error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps
 *  developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing
 *  error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or
 *  localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary
 *  information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types
 *  in the package `google.rpc` that can be used for common error conditions.
 *  # Language mapping
 *  The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but
 *  it
 *  is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is
 *  exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can
 *  be
 *  mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
 *  in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.
 *  # Other uses
 *  The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of
 *  environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
 *  consistent developer experience across different environments.
 *  Example uses of this error model include:
 *  - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
 *  it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
 *  errors.
 *  - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
 *  have a `Status` message for error reporting.
 *  - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
 *  `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for
 *  each error sub-response.
 *  - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
 *  results in its response, the status of those operations should be
 *  represented directly using the `Status` message.
 *  - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could
 *  be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.
